#. First, the blacklist. We list font families that can crash Tux Paint
#. via bugs in the SDL_ttf library. We also test fonts to be sure that
#. they have both uppercase and lowercase letters. Note that we do not
#. test for "Aa", because it is OK if uppercase and lowercase are the
#. same (but not nice -- such fonts get a low score later).
#.
#. Most locales leave the blacklist strings alone: "QX" and "qx"
#. (it is less destructive to use the scoring strings instead)
#.
#. Locales that absolutely require all fonts to have some
#. extra characters should use "QX..." and "qx...", where "..."
#. are some characters you absolutely require in all fonts.
#.
#. Locales with absolutely NO use for ASCII may use "..." and "...",
#. where "..." are some characters you absolutely require in
#. all fonts. This would be the case for a locale in which it is
#. impossible for a user to type ASCII letters.
#.
#. Most translators should use scoring instead.

#. If neccessary, translate any of following strings using at least
