base, then drag the mouse upwards to draw the stalk, and finally release the
mouse button to finish the flower. It will be drawn in the currently-selected
color. The shape and length of the stalk depends on how you move the mouse
while you drag.

This tool is operated in a freehand fashion.

This tool offers multiple size settings.
