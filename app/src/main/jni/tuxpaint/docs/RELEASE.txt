Release checklist for Tux Paint
Last updated 2023-05-29 -bjk

During development
------------------

Make sure any new options are documented in the "OPTIONS" docs
(now maintained in the "tuxpaint-docs" repository; see below),
the manpage (see below), and listed in the shell completion file
(src/tuxpaint-completion.bash), the "tuxpaint --help" output,
and the "Command-Line Options" section of the "OPTIONS" docs,
as appropriate.  Generally, new options should be exposed by
"Tux Paint Config." (in the "tuxpaint-config" repository),
and documented in its README, as well.

Make sure new features are recorded in "docs/CHANGES.txt", the
"What's New" section at the top of the current version's "README"
docs (now maintained in the "tuxpaint-docs" repository), and
in Tux Paint's appdata file (which is generated, with translated
text from PO files, based on "org.tuxpaint.Tuxpaint.appdata.xml.in").


Preparing
---------

Do these things _prior_ to cutting a release -- that is, prior to
tagging in the source code repository, running "make release" to roll
a .tar.gz source tarball, and making the tarball available for download.

 * Update version # and release dates

   Places to make sure version # and release date gets updated,

   * Makefile

   * Build description files:
     * tuxpaint.spec (Linux RPM package)
     * win32/resources.rc (Windows mingw/msys build)

   * Changelog
     * docs/CHANGES.txt

   * Metainfo file: (add entry for new version's changes)
     * src/org.tuxpaint.Tuxpaint.appdata.xml.in

   * Other Documentation

     NOTE: As of Tux Paint 0.9.26, most of the documentation
     is now maintained in a separate source-code repository,
     "tuxpaint-docs".  Updates should be made there, and
     then copied over to the "tuxpaint" repository.

     No matter what else might need to happen, these always need updating
     ahead of a new release:

     * Update version number in doc-src/include.php
     * Update What's New section in doc-src/README/README-whatsnew.php
       (things worth mentioning in the press release on the website)

     Here, be sure to run "make" in "docs/", to produce plaintext
     alternatives of the HTML files.

     * docs/en/html/README.html
     * docs/en/html/FAQ.html
     * docs/en/html/OPTIONS.html
     * docs/en/html/EXTENDING.html
     * docs/en/html/ADVANCED-STAMPS-HOWTO.html

   * Manual page (manpage)

     NOTE: Also maintained in "tuxpaint-docs" now; see above.

     * man/tuxpaint.1

 * Rebuild 'tuxpaint.desktop' by running "update-po.sh" in "src/po/"

 * Don't forget to commit the changes!  (git add ... / git commit / git push)


Time to release:
----------------

 * Tag & roll a release tarball (example here was from 0.9.25):

   $ git pull
   $ make clean
   $ git tag tuxpaint-0_9_25-2020-12-27
   $ git push origin tuxpaint-0_9_25-2020-12-27 # or --tags
   $ make release

 * Upload each project's ".tar.gz" file from their "build/" subdirs
   to ftp.tuxpaint.org.

 * Place them in the appropriate subdirectories (source/, config/,
   and stamps/) under "unix/x/tuxpaint/".

 * Copy "docs/CHANGES.txt" from each project onto the FTP site
   (Tux Paint's goes in the toplevel, the others go in config/ and
   stamps/).

 * Create a new PAD file (e.g. `pads/tuxpaint-0.9.25.xml`) on the
   FTP site.

 * Replace the "pads/tuxpaint-LATEST.xml" symlink on the FTP site with
   a new one that points to the new PAD file.

 * At SourceForge, go to "Files" and use "Add Folder" under each project
   to create new release file subdirectories.  (e.g., "0.9.25" under
   https://sourceforge.net/projects/tuxpaint/files/tuxpaint/)

 * Upload the files!  Either from local copies, via a web browser,
   or by SCP, Rsync, or SFTP (see
   https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/Release%20Files%20for%20Download/#scp)

   e.g.:

     $ sftp wkendrick@frs.sourceforge.net
     sftp> cd /home/frs/project/tuxpaint/

     sftp> cd tuxpaint/0.9.25/
     sftp> lcd source
     sftp> put tuxpaint-0.9.25.tar.gz

     sftp> cd ../..
     sftp> lcd ..

   [repeat for tuxpaint-config and tuxpaint-stamps]

 * Copy latest release's documentation to the tuxpaint.org website.
