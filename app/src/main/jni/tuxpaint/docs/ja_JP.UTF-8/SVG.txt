About SVGs

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an open standard used to describe
two-dimensional vector graphics. It is great for diagrams and shapes, while
PNGs are better for photographs. SVG files are a bit like instructions on how
to make an image. This means that they can be resized without looking pixelated
or blocky.

How to make SVGs

An excellent tool with which to create SVG images for use in Tux Paint is
Inkscape, a high-quality Open Source interactive drawing program available for
Windows, macOS, and Linux. There are also other applications that can produce
SVGs, both free/open source, and commerical/proprietary.
