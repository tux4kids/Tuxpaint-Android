   Tux Paint understands a number of environment variables, either directly,
   or indirectly by the libraries that it utilizes.

Storage-related environment variables

   HOME

           Specifies the user's "home directory", which is used to locate
           numerous other files or directories. In some cases, it is utilized
           as part of a fall-back location, when other environment variables
           (elsewhere in this documentation) are not set. Sometimes, the
           location to use can be overridden by options provided on the
           command-line or via Tux Paint's configuration file. See the
           "OPTIONS" documentation for details.

           A few examples of where "$HOME" is used include:

              * The location of Tux Paint's configuration file
              * The basis of where Tux Paint saves and loads users' drawings
              * The location of a user's private collection of data files —
                stamps, brushes, etc. — (versus those available system wide)

   XDG_CONFIG_HOME

           On Linux and other platforms where the X Desktop Group standards
           are used, the location of the user's configuration files.
           Specifically, where to find "user-dirs.dirs", where the
           "XDG_PICTURES_DIR" might be defined. It is used for exporting
           drawings and animated GIFs. Generally it's set to something like
           "$HOME/Pictures/". If not specified, Tux Paint checks in the
           directory "$HOME/.config/". If the configuration cannot be found,
           Tux Paint simply exports drawings and GIFs to "$HOME".

   XDG_DATA_HOME

           On Linux and other platforms where the X Desktop Group standards
           are used, the location of the user's data directories.
           Specifically, where to find the "Trash" directory. It is used when
           deleting images from Tux Paint's "Open" dialog. If not set, the
           location "$HOME/.local/share/Trash/" is used, if available. If
           not, images are simply deleted, rather than moved anywhere.

   TEMP

           Specifies the location where temporary files may be created. Only
           used by Tux Paint on Microsoft Windows OSes. Uses "userdata" if
           not set.

Language-related environment variables

   LANG

   LANGUAGE

   LC_ALL

   LC_MESSAGES

           Specify the language Tux Paint should utilize in its user
           interface. Overridde by the "--lang" and "--locale" command-line
           options or their configuration file counterparts. The "LANGUAGE"
           environment variable is used, if set. If not, "LC_ALL" is used as
           a fallback. Then "LC_MESSAGES", and finally "LANG".

Display-related environment variables

   The following are a few of the environment variables supported by Simple
   DirectMedia Layer (libSD) — which Tux Paint utilizes for displaying
   graphics, playing sounds, and receiving mouse, keyboard, and joystick
   input — and which may be useful to users of Tux Paint.

   SDL_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER

           Specifies whether Tux Paint should allow a screensaver to run. Can
           be set to '1' (true) by Tux Paint itself by issuing the
           command-line option "--allowscreensaver" or its configuration file
           counterpart.

   SDL_VIDEO_WINDOW_POS

           Requests where to position Tux Paint's window. Normally set to
           "center" by Tux Paint itself, unless the environment variable is
           already set (e.g., to "nopref", meaning "no preference").
