Requirements

  Simple DirectMedia Layer library (libSDL)

       Tux Paint requires the Simple DirectMedia Layer Library (libSDL), an
       Open Source multimedia programming library available under the GNU
       Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

       Along with libSDL, Tux Paint depends on a number of other SDL 'helper'
       libraries: SDL_Image (for graphics files), SDL_gfx (for some graphical
       functions, like rotation), SDL_TTF and (optionally) SDL_Pango (for
       True Type Font support) and, optionally, SDL_Mixer (for sound
       effects).

    Linux/Unix Users:

         The SDL libraries are available as source-code, or as RPM or Debian
         packages for various distributions of Linux. They can be downloaded
         from:

           * libSDL: http://www.libsdl.org/
           * SDL_Image: http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
           * SDL_gfx:
             https://www.ferzkopp.net/wordpress/2016/01/02/sdl_gfx-sdl2_gfx/
             (https://sourceforge.net/projects/sdlgfx/)
           * SDL_TTF: http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
           * SDL_Pango: http://sourceforge.net/projects/sdlpango/ (optional)
           * SDL_Mixer: http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/ (optional)

         They are also typically available along with your Linux distribution
         (e.g. on an installation media, or available via package
         maintainance software like Debian's "apt").

         Note: When installing libraries from packages, be sure to ALSO
         install the development versions of the packages. (For example,
         install both "SDL-1.2.4.rpm" and "SDL-1.2.4-devel.rpm".)

  Other Libraries

       Tux Paint also takes advantage of a number of other free, LGPL'd
       libraries. Under Linux, just like SDL, they should either already be
       installed, or are readily available for installation as part of your
       Linux distribution.

    libPNG

         Tux Paint uses PNG (Portable Network Graphics) format for its data
         files. SDL_image will require libPNG be installed.

         http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html

    gettext

         Tux Paint uses your system's locale settings along with the
         "gettext" library to support various languages (e.g., Spanish).
         You'll need the gettext library installed.

         http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/

    libpaper (Linux/Unix only)

         As of Tux Paint 0.9.17, Tux Paint can determine your system's
         default paper size (e.g., A4 or Letter), or can be told to use a
         particular paper size, thanks to "libpaper".

         https://github.com/naota/libpaper

    FriBiDi

         Tux Paint's "Text" and also "Label" tools support bidirectional
         languages, thanks to the "FriBiDi" library.

         http://fribidi.org/

    SVG graphics support

         As of Tux Paint 0.9.17, Tux Paint can load SVG (Scalable Vector
         Graphics) images as stamps. Two sets of libraries are supported, and
         SVG support can be completely disabled (via "make SVG_LIB:=")

      librsvg-2 & libCairo2 (newer libraries)

           * libRSVG 2: http://librsvg.sourceforge.net/
           * Cairo 2: http://www.cairographics.org/
           * These also depend on the following:
                * GdkPixbuf & GLib: http://www.gtk.org/
                * Pango: http://www.pango.org/

      Older SVG libraries

           * libcairo1, libsvg1, & libsvg-cairo1:
             http://www.cairographics.org/
           * These also depend on the following:
                * libxml2: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2

    Animated GIF Export feature

         To support export of animated GIFs (slideshows), the "libimagequant"
         library (from the "pngquant2" project) is required.

         https://github.com/ImageOptim/libimagequant

    NetPBM Tools (optional) No longer used, by default

         Under Linux and Unix, earlier versions of Tux Paint used the NetPBM
         tools to assist with printing. (A PNG is generated by Tux Paint, and
         converted into a PostScript using the 'pngtopnm' and 'pnmtops'
         NetPBM command-line tools.)

         http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Compiling and Installation

     Tux Paint is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) (see
     "COPYING.txt" for details), and therefore the 'source code' to the
     program is available freely.

    Compiling Set-Up

         As of February 2005 (starting with Tux Paint 0.9.15), the "Makefile"
         includes support for building on a Windows system using MinGW/MSYS
         (https://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/).

         Many tools and libraries are required to build Tux Paint. The
         package management system "pacman" helps you install them
         automatically solving complicated dependencies.

         Download the latest MSYS2 environment from
         https://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/files/Base/ and install it
         where you'd like (the default is "C:\msys64")

         Open the MSYS2 shell from the "Start Menu" -> "MSYS2 64bit" ->
         "MSYS2 MSYS" and execute following command (press [Enter] or
         [Return] to accept the defaults for all questions):

           pacman -Syu

         This will update core system and the window will close
         automatically. Repeat the steps above one more time to finish the
         remaining update process.

         Within the MSYS2 shell, run the following command to install basic
         development tools:

           pacman -S base-devel msys2-devel git

       Proceed to the next "MinGW 64bit (x86_64) toolchains" section, or skip
       to the "MinGW 32bit (i686) toolchains" section if you need only a
       32bit build environment.

            -------------------------------------------------------

    MinGW 64bit (x86_64) toolchains

         Within the MSYS2 shell, run the following command to install basic
         64bit development tools:

           pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain

    64bit (x86_64) dependency libraries for Tux Paint

         You can install tools and libraries required for compiling Tux Paint
         on MSYS2/MINGW using "pacman" except for SDL_Pango.

         "ntldd" is a small tool which examine windows executable files to
         list Dynamic Link Library (.dll) files they depends on. Tux Paint's
         packaging process for binary distribution uses it to find required
         .dll files.

         FLTK is a cross-platform GUI toolkit used by "Tux Paint Config.".
         You can skip installing it if you are only building "Tux Paint".

           $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL_{image,mixer,ttf,gfx}
           $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-librsvg
           $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-fribidi
           $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-libimagequant
           $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-fltk
           $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-ntldd-git

         Note: Close the shell before proceeding to the remaining process.

    Install SDL_Pango on the 64bit environment

         SDL_Pango should be installed manually.

         This time, use the MinGW "64bit" shell. Open the shell from the
         "Start Menu" -> "MSYS2 64bit" -> "MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit"

      SDL_Pango

           At first, you have to prepare source tar-ball and a required patch
           in the same directory.

             * Download source tar-ball of SDL_Pango-0.1.2 from SDL_Pango's
               page on Sourceforge.net.
             * Download a patch file from John Popplewell's "Tux Paint -
               MinGW/MSYS build instructions" webpage. (This adds some extra
               (required) functionality to SDL_Pango.)

           Build and install SDL_Pango as follows.

             $ tar zxvf SDL_Pango-0.1.2.tar.gz
             $ cd SDL_Pango-0.1.2/
             $ patch -p0 < ../SDL_Pango-configure-extra-api.patch
             $ ./configure --prefix=/mingw64 && make && make install

       Proceed to the next "MinGW 32bit (i686) toolchains" section, or skip
       to the "ImageMagick" section if you need only a 64bit build
       environment.

            -------------------------------------------------------

    MinGW 32bit (i686) toolchains

         Within the MSYS2 shell, run the following command to install basic
         32bit development tools:

           pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain

    32bit (i686) dependency libraries for Tux Paint

         You can install tools and libraries required for compiling Tux Paint
         on MSYS2/MINGW using "pacman" except for SDL_Pango.

         "ntldd" is a small tool which examine windows executable files to
         list Dynamic Link Library (.dll) files they depends on. Tux Paint's
         packaging process for binary distribution uses it to find required
         .dll files.

         FLTK is a cross-platform GUI toolkit used by "Tux Paint Config.".
         You can skip installing it if you are only building "Tux Paint".

           $ pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-SDL_{image,mixer,ttf,gfx}
           $ pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-librsvg
           $ pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-fribidi
           $ pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-libimagequant
           $ pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-fltk
           $ pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-ntldd-git

         Note: Close the shell before proceeding to the remaining process.

    Install SDL_Pango on the 32bit environment

         SDL_Pango should be installed manually.

         This time, use the MinGW "32bit" shell. Open the shell from the
         "Start Menu" -> "MSYS2 64bit" -> "MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit"

      SDL_Pango

           At first, you have to prepare source tar-ball and a required patch
           in the same directory.

             * Download source tar-ball of SDL_Pango-0.1.2 from SDL_Pango's
               page on Sourceforge.net.
             * Download a patch file from John Popplewell's "Tux Paint -
               MinGW/MSYS build instructions" webpage. (This adds some extra
               (required) functionality to SDL_Pango.)

           Build and install SDL_Pango as follows.

             $ tar zxvf SDL_Pango-0.1.2.tar.gz
             $ cd SDL_Pango-0.1.2/
             $ patch -p0 < ../SDL_Pango-configure-extra-api.patch
             $ ./configure --prefix=/mingw32 && make && make install

            -------------------------------------------------------

    ImageMagick

         ImageMagick is a compilation of command line tools to create, edit,
         compose, or convert bitmap images supporting quite a large number of
         image formats. Tux Paint uses two functions ("convert" and
         "composite") in it to generate thumbnails for startar images and
         templates during the build process.

         Using official binary release available from "Windows Binary
         Release" is recommended, due to the commands installed with "pacman"
         on MinGW/MSYS not working as expected!

         Do not forget to enable "Install legacy utilities (e.g. convert)"
         while installing it, because Tux Paint's build process uses them.

         Add the path to the directory in which ImageMagick is installed at
         the top of your "PATH" environment variable. For example:

           $ export PATH=/c/Program\ Files/ImageMagick-7.0.10-Q16-HDRI:$PATH

         You can make this permanent by adding the above to your the BASH
         shell configuration file, "~/.bash_profile".

            -------------------------------------------------------

    Tux Paint

         You can compile 64bit binaries using MSYS2 64bit shell, and 32bit
         binaries using MSYS2 32bit shell, respectively.

           * Select "MSYS2 64bit" -> "MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit" from the "Start
             Menu" to open the 64bit shell.
           * Select "MSYS2 64bit" -> "MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit" from the "Start
             Menu" to open the 32bit shell.

         Compile Tux Paint with the following command:

           $ make bdist-win32

         Note: At this point, you will want to build "Tux Paint Config." for
         Windows, so it can be included along with "Tux Paint", if you're
         making an official (or test) release. The build process will look
         for it in a directory named "tuxpaint-config" (with no version
         number, e.g., "tuxpaint-config-X.Y.Z"). See "Tux Paint Config."'s
         INSTALL.txt documentation for details.

         All the files needed for starting Tux Paint (and Tux Paint Config.)
         are collected in the directory for binary distribution "bdist"
         directory under "win32". You can start them by double-clicking their
         executable (.exe) files in the "bdist" directory.

            -------------------------------------------------------

    Building the Tux Paint Windows Installer:

         Inno Setup is used to build executable installer for Tux Paint.
         Therefore you have to install it in the first place.

         Inno Setup officially supports translations for only about 20
         languages. However, one of the great points of Tux Paint is it
         supports so many languages. Therefore, the set up script
         "tuxpaint.iss" to build the installer is written to use much more
         translations including unofficial one which are available on "Inno
         Setup Translations". You have to download translation files (.isl)
         required and put them in "Languages" directory under the directory
         in which Inno Setup is installed.

         Before building an installer, edit the "tuxpaint.iss" file and
         enable one of the lines starting with "#define BuildTarget=",
         depending on the architecture of the installer you want to create.

         Then, you can easily build an executable installer by right-clicking
         on the "tuxpaint.iss" icon in the "win32" directory and selecting
         "Compile" on the list. It will run for a while, and eventually you
         will find a "tuxpaint-X.Y.Z-windows-<arch>-installer.exe" file in
         the same directory.

            -------------------------------------------------------

    Running the Tux Paint Windows Installer:

         Double-click the Tux Paint installer executable (.EXE file) and
         follow the instructions.

         First, you will be asked to read the license. (It is the GNU General
         Public License (GPL), which is also available as "COPYING.txt".)

         You will then be asked whether you want to install shortcuts to Tux
         Paint in your Windows Start Menu and on your Windows Desktop. (Both
         options are set by default.)

         Then you will be asked where you wish to install Tux Paint. The
         default should be suitable, as long as there is space available.
         Otherwise, pick a different location.

         At this point, you can click 'Install' to install Tux Paint!

            -------------------------------------------------------

    Changing the Settings Using the Shortcut:

         To change program settings, right-click on the TuxPaint shortcut and
         select 'Properties' (at the bottom).

         Make sure the 'Shortcut' tab is selected in the window that appears,
         and examine the 'Target:' field. You should see something like this:

           "C:\Program Files\TuxPaint\TuxPaint.exe"

         You can now add command-line options which will be enabled when you
         double-click the icon.

         For example, to make the game run in fullscreen mode, with simple
         shapes (no rotation option) and in French, add the options (after
         'TuxPaint.exe'), like so:

           "C:\Program Files\TuxPaint\TuxPaint.exe" -f -s --lang french

         (See the main documentation for a full list of available
         command-line options.)

         If you make a mistake or it all disappears use [Ctrl] + [Z] to undo
         or just hit the [Esc] key and the box will close with no changes
         made (unless you pushed the "Apply" button!).

         When you have finished, click "OK."

            -------------------------------------------------------

    If Something Goes Wrong:

         If, when you double-click on the shortcut to run Tux Paint, nothing
         happens, it is probably because some of these command-line options
         are wrong. Open an Explorer like before, and look for a file called
         "stderr.txt" in the TuxPaint folder.

         It will contain a description of what was wrong. Usually it will
         just be due to incorrect character-case (capital 'Z' instead of
         lowercase 'z') or a missing (or extra) '-' (dash).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Linux または Unix のユーザー

    Compiling:

         Note: Tux Paint does not use autoconf/automake, so there is no
         "./configure" script to run. Compiling should be straight-forward
         though, assuming everything Tux Paint needs is installed.

         To compile the program from source, simply run the following command
         from a shell prompt (e.g., "$"):

           $ make

            -------------------------------------------------------

    Disabling SVG support (and hence Cairo, libSVG, and svg-cairo dependencies):

         To disable SVG support (e.g., if your system is not currently
         supported by the Cairo library or other SVG-related dependencies),
         you can run "make" with "SVG_LIB= SVG_CFLAGS= NOSVGFLAG=NOSVG"
         added:

           $ make SVG_LIB= SVG_CFLAGS=

            -------------------------------------------------------

    Disabling Pango support (and hence Pango, Cairo, etc. dependencies):

         Prior to version 0.9.18, Tux Paint used the libSDL_ttf library for
         rendering text using TrueType Fonts. Since 0.9.18, libSDL_Pango is
         used, as it has much greater support for internationalization.
         However, if you wish to disable the use of SDL_Pango, you may do so
         running "make" with "SDL_PANGO_LIB=" added:

           $ make SDL_PANGO_LIB=

            -------------------------------------------------------

    Disabling Sound at Compile-time:

         If you don't have a sound card, or would prefer to build the program
         with no sound support (and therefore without a the SDL_mixer
         dependency), you can run "make" with "SDL_MIXER_LIB=" added:

           $ make SDL_MIXER_LIB=

            -------------------------------------------------------

    Other options:

         Various other options (e.g., installation paths) may be overridden;
         see them in "Makefile" for further details.

            -------------------------------------------------------

    If you get errors:

         If you receive any errors during compile-time, make sure you have
         the appropriate libraries installed (see above). If using packaged
         versions of the libraries (e.g., RPMs under RedHat or DEBs under
         Debian), be sure to get the corresponding "-dev" or "-devel"
         packages as well, otherwise you won't be able to compile Tux Paint
         (and other programs) from source!

            -------------------------------------------------------

    Installng:

         Assuming no fatal errors occured, you can now install the program so
         that it can be run by users on the system. By default, this must be
         done by the "root" user ('superuser'). Switch to "root" by typing
         the command:

           $ su

         Enter "root"'s password at the prompt. You should now be "root"
         (with a prompt like "#"). To install the program and its data files,
         type:

           # make install

         Finally, you can switch back to your regular user by exiting
         superuser mode:

           # exit

         Alternatively, you may be able to simply use the "sudo" command
         (e.g., on Ubuntu Linux):

           $ sudo make install

         Note: By default, "tuxpaint", the executable program, is placed in
         "/usr/local/bin/". The data files (images, sounds, etc.) are placed
         in "/usr/local/share/tuxpaint/".

      Changing Where Things Go

           You can change where things will go by setting "Makefile"variables
           on the command line. "DESTDIR" is used to place output in a
           staging area for package creation. "PREFIX" is the basis of where
           all other files go, and is, by default, set to "/usr/local".

           Other variables are:

           BIN_PREFIX
                   Where the "tuxpaint" binary will be installed. (Set to
                   "$(PREFIX)/bin" by default - e.g., "/usr/local/bin")

           DATA_PREFIX
                   Where the data files (sound, graphics, brushes, stamps,
                   fonts) will go, and where Tux Paint will look for them
                   when it's run. (Set to "$(PREFIX)/share/tuxpaint")

           DOC_PREFIX
                   Where the documentation text files (the "docs" directory)
                   will go. (Set to "$(PREFIX)/share/doc/tuxpaint")

           MAN_PREFIX
                   Where the manual page for Tux Paint will go. (Set to
                   "$(PREFIX)/share/man")

           ICON_PREFIX — $(PREFIX)/share/pixmaps

           X11_ICON_PREFIX — $(PREFIX)/X11R6/include/X11/pixmaps

           GNOME_PREFIX — $(PREFIX)/share/gnome/apps/Graphics

           KDE_PREFIX — $(PREFIX)/share/applnk/Graphics
                   Where the icons and launchers (for GNOME and KDE) will go.

           LOCALE_PREFIX
                   Where the translation files for Tux Paint will go, and
                   where Tux Paint will look for them. (Set to
                   "$(PREFIX)/share/locale/") (Final location of a
                   translation file will be under the locale's directory
                   (e.g., "es" for Spanish), within the "LC_MESSAGES"
                   subdirectory.)

           Note: This list is out of date. See "Makefile" and "Makefile-i18n"
           for a complete list.

       Tux Paint 0.9.22 and earlier required building Tux Paint from the
       Xcode IDE. Starting with 0.9.23, however, Tux Paint for macOS is built
       as though it were a Linux application.

    Prerequisites

         Although Tux Paint is built without the Xcode IDE, Xcode itself is
         still required to build Tux Paint. Download it from the App Store,
         and launch it once to accept its license agreements. You may also
         need to install the Xcode command line tools using the command:

           xcode-select --install

         Building Tux Paint also requires various libraries. We install them
         from MacPorts where possible, source code otherwise. Install
         MacPorts to the default /opt/local path according to the
         instructions found on their website: https://www.macports.org/
           * ImageMagick
           * cairo
           * fribidi
           * lbzip2
           * libimagequant^*
           * libpaper
           * libpng
           * librsvg
           * libsdl
           * libsdl_image
           * libsdl_mixer
           * libsdl_pango
           * libsdl_ttf
           * libsdl_gfx
           * pkgconfig
           * zlib
         ... but you should install any package that is required by the
         latest version of Tux Paint.

         ^* Not available from MacPorts as of this writing, see below.

      libimagequant

           libimagequant is not available from MacPorts as of this writing.
           It can be installed from the source code as follows. It should be
           installed to /opt/local (same as MacPorts) for the library to be
           included in TuxPaint.dmg.

             $ git clone https://github.com/ImageOptim/libimagequant.git
             $ cd libimagequant
             $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/local
             $ make
             $ sudo make install

         WARNING: Having any UNIX-like toolset installed on your Mac besides
         MacPorts and Xcode, such as Fink or Brew, will prevent your app
         bundle from being portable. Be sure Fink and Brew are not accessible
         from your build environment.

            -------------------------------------------------------

    How to Build

         Simply, run:

           % make
           % make install

         ... to create the TuxPaint.app application bundle that can be run
         in-place or copied to /Applications. It also creates TuxPaint.dmg
         for distribution.

            -------------------------------------------------------

    Known Issues

           * A macOS binary built on a specific version of macOS only runs on
             that version of macOS or later. To ensure Tux Paint can run on
             the oldest version of macOS possible, build it on the oldest
             version of macOS available. As of this writing we know Tux Paint
             cannot be built to run on macOS 10.7 or earlier.

             See "Old Versions of macOS" below for best-effort instructions
             on how to obtain, install, and build Tux Paint on an old version
             of macOS.

            -------------------------------------------------------

    Old Versions of macOS

         Some old versions of macOS can be downloaded from Apple's support
         page: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211683

         macOS does allow dual booting of multiple versions of the OS, but
         it's safer and easier to install the old macOS onto a flash drive.
         Wherever you're installing it, the target drive's partitioniong
         scheme and partition type must match what the old macOS expects, so
         use the Disk Utility to partition and format the flash drive
         accordingly.

         As of this writing, the oldest version of macOS available on Apple's
         support site is Yosemite 10.10, which expects "GPT (GUID Partition
         Table)" partitioning scheme instead of the older MBR scheme, and
         "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)" as the partition type instead of the
         newer APFS partition type.

         Upon launching the installer, if you get a popup about macOS being
         too old or new to be installed, a bootable installer can be created
         using the instructions found here:
         https://support.apple.com/en-mide/HT201372

         It has been found that macOS can be installed onto the bootable
         media itself, so you can make the flash drive into a bootable
         installer then install the old macOS onto the same flash drive.

         Once the old macOS is installed, you may find the Xcode on the App
         Store is too new to run on the version of the old macOS. Old
         versions of Xcode can be downloaded from Apple's Developer site in
         an area accessible with free registration:
         https://developer.apple.com/download/more/

         The list of macOS versions and the last version of Xcode compatible
         with them are laid out nicely on the Wikipedia page on Xcode:
         https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode#Version_comparison_table

         And because Xcode is being installed manually, you can skip the step
         to install the Xcode command line tools (do not run "xcode-select
         --install") but otherwise build Tux Paint using the same steps
         described in the earlier part of this document.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Debugging

     Debugging output — to "STDOUT" on Linux and Unix, to a "stdout.txt" file
     on Windows, and to the file "/tmp/tuxpaint.log" on macOS — can be
     enabled by setting "DEBUG" (and, if verbose logging is wanted,
     "VERBOSE") #defines in "src/debug.h" and (re)compiling Tux Paint.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Uninstalling Tux Paint

  Windows

    Using the Uninstaller

         If you installed the Start Menu shortcuts (the default), then go to
         the TuxPaint folder and select "Uninstall". A box will be displayed
         that will confirm that you are about to uninstall Tux Paint and, if
         you are certain that you want to permanently remove Tux Paint, click
         on the 'Uninstall' button.

         When it has finished, click on the close button.

    Using the Control Panel

         It is also possible to use the entry "TuxPaint (remove only)" in the
         Control Panel Add/Remove programs section.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  macOS

       Delete "TuxPaint.app" from the "Applications" folder. Data files,
       including the configuration files, stamps, and saved pictures, may be
       found in "Library/Application Support/TuxPaint" (all users) and
       "/Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/TuxPaint" (individual
       users).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Linux

       Within the Tux Paint source directory (where you compiled Tux Paint),
       you can use the "make uninstall" target to uninstall Tux Paint. By
       default, this must be done by the "root" user ('superuser'), but if
       you installed Tux Paint somewhere else (e.g., using a "PREFIX=..."
       setting to "make" and "make install"), you may not, and will want to
       provide those same settings here. (See the installation instructions
       above for further information.)
