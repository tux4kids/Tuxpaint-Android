                                   About SVGs

   SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an open standard used to describe
   two-dimensional vector graphics. It is great for diagrams and shapes,
   while PNGs are better for photographs. SVG files are a bit like
   instructions on how to make an image. This means that they can be resized
   without looking pixelated or blocky.

                                How to make SVGs

   An excellent tool with which to create SVG images for use in Tux Paint is
   Inkscape, a high-quality Open Source interactive drawing program available
   for Windows, macOS, and Linux. There are also other applications that can
   produce SVGs, both free/open source, and commerical/proprietary.
