     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   If you wish to add or change things like Brushes, Starters, Rubber Stamps,
   and other content used by Tux Paint, you can do so fairly easily by simply
   adding, changing, or removing files where Tux Paint looks for them.

   Note: You'll need to re-launch Tux Paint for the changes to take effect.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Where Files Go

  Standard Files

       Tux Paint looks for its various data files in its 'data' directory.

    Linux and Unix

         Where this directory goes depends on what value was set for
         "DATA_PREFIX" when Tux Paint was built. See 'Install documentation'
         for details.

         By default, though, the directory is:

           /usr/local/share/tuxpaint/

         If you installed from a package, it is more likely to be:

           /usr/share/tuxpaint/

    Windows

         Tux Paint looks for a directory called 'data' in the same directory
         as the executable. This is the directory that the installer used
         when installing Tux Paint e.g.:

           C:\Program Files\TuxPaint\data

    macOS

         Tux Paint stores its data files inside the "Tux Paint" application
         icon (which is actually a special kind of folder on macOS & Mac OS X
         before it). The following steps explain how to get to the folders
         within it:

          1. Bring up a 'context' menu by holding the [Control] key and
             clicking the Tux Paint icon the in Finder. (If you have a mouse
             with more than one button, you can simply right-click the icon.)
          2. Select "Show Contents" from the menu that appears. A new Finder
             window will appear with a folder inside called "Contents".
          3. Open the "Contents" folder and open the "Resources" folder found
             inside.
          4. There, you will find various sub-folders, such as "starters",
             "stamps", "brushes", etc. Adding new content to these folders
             will make the content available to any user that launches this
             copy (icon) of Tux Paint.

         Note: If you install a newer version of Tux Paint and replace or
         discard the old version, you will lose changes made by following the
         instructions above, so keep backups of your new content (stamps,
         brushes, etc.).

         Tux Paint also looks for files in a "TuxPaint" folder that you can
         place in your system's "Application Support" folder (found under
         "Library" at the root of your filesystem):

           /Library/Application Support/TuxPaint/

         When you upgrade to a newer version of Tux Paint, the contents of
         this "TuxPaint" folder will stay the same, and remain accessible by
         all users of Tux Paint.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Personal Files

       You can also create brushes, stamps, 'starters', templates, and fonts
       in your own user account directory (folder) for Tux Paint to find.

    Windows

         Your personal Tux Paint folder is stored in your personal
         "Application Data". For example, on newer Windows:

           C:\Documents and Settings\(username)\Application Data\TuxPaint\

    macOS

         Your personal Tux Paint folder is stored in your personal
         "Application Support" folder:

           /Users/(username)/Library/Application Support/TuxPaint/

    Linux and Unix

         Your personal Tux Paint files go into a 'hidden directory' found in
         your account's home directory: "$(HOME)/.tuxpaint/" (also known as
         "~/.tuxpaint/").

         That is, if your home directory is "/home/tux", then your personal
         Tux Paint files go in "/home/tux/.tuxpaint/".

         Don't forget the period (".") before the "tuxpaint"!

       To add your own brushes, stamps, 'starters,' templates, and fonts,
       create subdirectories under your personal Tux Paint directory named
       "brushes", "stamps", "starters", "templates", "fonts", respectively.

       (For example, if you created a brush named "flower.png", you would put
       it in "~/.tuxpaint/brushes/" under Linux or Unix.)

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Brushes

     The brushes used for drawing with the 'Brush' and 'Lines' tools in Tux
     Paint are simply PNG image files.

     The alpha (transparency) of the PNG image is used to determine the shape
     of the brush, which means that the shape can be 'anti-aliased' and even
     partially-transparent!

     Greyscale pixels in the brush PNG will be drawn using the
     currently-selected color in Tux Paint. Color pixels will be tinted.

  Brush Options

       Aside from a graphical shape, brushes can also be given other
       attributes. To do this, you need to create a 'data file' for the
       brush.

       A brush's data file is simply a plain ASCII text file containing the
       options for the brush.

       The file has the same name as the PNG image, but a ".dat" extension.
       (e.g., "brush.png"'s data file is the text file "brush.dat", found in
       the same directory.)

    Brush Spacing

         As of Tux Paint version 0.9.16, you can now specify the spacing for
         brushes (that is, how often they are drawn). By default, the spacing
         will be the brush's height, divided by 4.

         Add a line containing the line "spacing=N" to the brush's data file,
         where "N" is the spacing you want for the brush. (The lower the
         number, the more often the brush is drawn.)

    Animated Brushes

         As of Tux Paint version 0.9.16, you may now create animated brushes.
         As the brush is used, each frame of the animation is drawn.

         Lay each frame out across a wide PNG image. For example, if your
         brush is 30x30 and you have 5 frames, the image should be 150x30.

         Add a line containing the line "frames=N" to the brush's data file,
         where "N" is the number of frames in the brush.

         Note: If you'd rather the frames be flipped through randomly, rather
         than sequentially, also add a line containing "random" to the
         brush's data file.

    Directional Brushes

         As of Tux Paint version 0.9.16, you may now create directional
         brushes. As the brush is used, different shapes are drawn, depending
         on the direction the brush is going.

         The directional shapes are divided into a 3x3 square in a PNG image.
         For example, if your brush is 30x30, the image should be 90x90, and
         each of the direction's shapes placed in a 3x3 grid. The center
         region is used for no motion. The top right is used for motion
         that's both up, and to the right. And so on.

         Add a line containing the word "directional" to the brush's data
         file.

    Animated Directional Brushes

         You may mix both animated and directional features into one brush.
         Use both options ("frames=N" and "directional"), in separate lines
         in the brush's ".dat" file.

         Lay the brush out so that each 3x3 set of directional shapes are
         laid out across a wide PNG image. For example, if the brush is 30x30
         and there are 5 frames, it would be 450x90. (The leftmost 150x90
         pixels of the image represent the 9 direction shapes for the first
         frame, for example.)

     Place the brush image PNGs (and any data text files) in the "brushes"
     directory.

     Note: If your new brushes all come out as solid squares or rectangles,
     it's because you forgot to use alpha transparency! See the 'PNG
     documentation' in Tux Paint for more information and tips.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Stamps

     All stamp-related files go in the "stamps" directory. It's useful to
     create subdirectories and sub-subdirectories there to organize the
     stamps. (For example, you can have a "holidays" folder with "halloween"
     and "christmas" sub-folders.)

  Stamp Images

       Rubber Stamps in Tux Paint can be made up of a number of separate
       files. The one file that is required is, of course, the picture
       itself.

       As of Tux Paint version 0.9.17, Stamps may be either PNG bitmap images
       or SVG vector images. They can be full-color or greyscale. The alpha
       (transparency) channel of PNGs is used to determine the actual shape
       of the picture (otherwise you'll stamp a large rectangle on your
       drawings).

       PNGs can be any size, and Tux Paint (by default) provides a set of
       sizing buttons to let the user scale the stamp up (larger) and down
       (smaller).

       SVGs are vector-based, and will be scaled appropriately for the canvas
       size being used in Tux Paint.

       Note: If your new PNG-based stamps all come out as solid squares or
       rectangles, it's because you forgot to use alpha transparency! See the
       'PNG documentation' in Tux Paint for more information and tips.

       Note: If your new SVG stamps seem to have a lot of whitespace, make
       sure the SVG 'document' is no larger than the shape(s) within. If they
       are being clipped, make sure the 'document' is large enough to contain
       the shape(s). See the 'SVG documentation' in Tux Paint for more
       information and tips.

       Advanced Users: The 'Advanced Stamps How-To' document describes, in
       detail, how to make PNG images which will scale perfectly when used as
       stamps in Tux Paint.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Stamp Descriptive Text

       Tux Paint will display descriptive text when a stamp is selected.
       These are placed in plain text files with the same name as the PNG or
       SVG, but with a ".txt" filename extension. (e.g., "stamp.png"'s
       description is stored in "stamp.txt" in the same directory.)

       The first line of the text file will be used as the US English
       description of the stamp's image. It must be encoded in UTF-8.

    Localization Support

         Additional lines can be added to the text file to provide
         translations of the description, to be displayed when Tux Paint is
         running in a different locale (like French or Spanish).

         The beginning of the line should correspond to the language code of
         the language in question (e.g., "fr" for French, and "zh_TW" for
         Traditional Chinese), followed by ".utf8=" and the translated
         description (Unicode, encoded in UTF-8).

         For Tux Paint developers: There are scripts in the "po" directory
         for converting the text files to PO format (and back) for easy
         translation to different languages. Therefore you should never add
         or change translations in the ".txt" files directly.

         If no translation is available for the language Tux Paint is
         currently running in, the US English text is used.

    Windows Users

         Use NotePad or WordPad to edit/create these files. Be sure to save
         them as plain-text, and make sure they have a ".txt" extension at
         the end of the filename.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Stamp Sound Effects

       Tux Paint can play a sound effect when a stamp is selected. For
       example, the sound of a duck quaking when selecting a duck, or a brief
       piece of music when a musical instrument is chosen. Files may be in
       "WAVE (".wav")" or "OGG Vorbis (".ogg")" formats, and are given same
       name as the PNG or SVG image. (e.g., "stamp.svg"'s sound effect is the
       sound file "stamp.ogg" in the same directory.)

    Localization Support

         For sounds for different locales (e.g., if the sound is someone
         saying a word, and you want translated versions of the word said),
         also create WAV or OGG files with the locale's label in the
         filename, in the form: "stamp_LOCALE.EXT"

         "stamp.png"'s sound effect, when Tux Paint is run in Spanish mode,
         would be "stamp.png". In French mode, "stamp_es.wav". In Brazilian
         Portuguese mode, "stamp_fr.wav". And so on...

         If no localized sound effect can be loaded, Tux Paint will attempt
         to load the 'default' sound file. (e.g., "stamp.wav")

       Note: For descriptive sounds (not sound effects, like a bang or a bird
       chirping), consider using descriptive sounds; see 'Stamp Descriptive
       Sound', below.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Stamp Descriptive Sound

       Tux Paint can also play a descriptive sound when a stamp is selected.
       For example, the sound of someone saying the word "duck" when
       selecting a duck, or the name of a musical instrument when one is
       chosen. Files may be in "WAVE (".wav")" or "OGG Vorbis (".ogg")"
       formats, and are given same name as the PNG or SVG image, with "_desc"
       at the end. (e.g., "stamp.svg"'s descriptive sound is the sound file
       "stamp_desc.ogg" in the same directory.)

    Localization Support

         For descriptive sounds for different locales, also create WAV or OGG
         files with both "_desc" and the locale's label in the filename, in
         the form: "stamp_desc_LOCALE.EXT"

         "stamp.png"'s descriptive sound, when Tux Paint is run in Spanish
         mode, would be "stamp_desc_es.wav". In French mode,
         "stamp_desc_fr.wav". In Brazilian Portuguese mode,
         "stamp_desc_pt_BR.wav". And so on...

         If no localized descriptive sound can be loaded, Tux Paint will
         attempt to load the 'default' sound file. (e.g., "stamp_desc.wav")

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Stamp Options

       Aside from a graphical shape, a textual description, a sound effect,
       and a descriptive sound, stamps can also be given other attributes. To
       do this, you need to create a 'data file' for the stamp.

       A stamp's data file is simply a plain ASCII text file containing the
       options for the stamp.

       The file has the same name as the PNG or SVG image, but a ".dat"
       extension. (e.g., "stamp.png"'s data file is the text file
       "stamp.dat", found in the same directory.)

    Colored Stamps

         Stamps can be made to be either "colorable" or "tintable."

      Colorable

           "Colorable" stamps they work much like brushes - you pick the
           stamp to get the shape, and then pick the color you want it to be.
           (Symbol stamps, like the mathematical and musical ones, are an
           example.)

           Nothing about the original image is used except the transparency
           (from "alpha" channel). The color of the stamp comes out solid.

           Add a line containing the word "colorable" to the stamp's data
           file.

      Tinted

           "Tinted" stamps are similar to "colorable" ones, except the
           details of the original image are kept. (To put it technically,
           the original image is used, but its hue is changed, based on the
           currently-selected color.)

           Add a line containing the word "tintable" to the stamp's data
           file.

        Tinting Options:

             Depending on the contents of your stamp, you might want to have
             Tux Paint use one of a number of methods when tinting it. Add
             one of the following lines to the stamp's data file:

             Normal tinter — "tinter=normal" (the default)
                     This is the normal tinting mode. (Hue range is ±18°, 27
                     replace.)

             'Any hue' tinter — "tinter=anyhue"
                     This remaps all hues in the stamp. (Hue range is ±180°.)

             Narrow tinter — "tinter=narrow"
                     This like the "anyhue" option, but with a narrower hue
                     angle. (Hue range is ±6°, 9 replace.)

             Vector tinter — "tinter=vector"
                     This maps 'black through white' to 'black through
                     destination'.

    Unalterable Stamps

         By default, a stamp can be flipped upside down, shown as a mirror
         image, or both. This is done using the control buttons below the
         stamp selector, at the lower right side of the screen in Tux Paint.

         Sometimes, it doesn't make sense for a stamp to be flippable or
         mirrored; for example, stamps of letters or numbers. Sometimes
         stamps are symmetrical, so letting the user flip or mirror them
         isn't useful.

         To prevent a stamp from being flipped vertically, add the option
         "noflip" to the stamp's data file.

         To prevent a stamp from being mirrored horizontally, add the option
         "nomirror" to the stamp's data file.

    Initial Stamp Size

         By default, Tux Paint assumes that your stamp is sized appropriately
         for unscaled display on a 608x472 canvas. This was the original Tux
         Paint canvas size, provided by a 640x480 screen. Tux Paint will then
         adjust the stamp according to the current canvas size and, if
         enabled, the user's stamp size controls.

         If your stamp would be too big or too small, you can specify a scale
         factor. If your stamp would be 2.5 times as wide (or tall) as it
         should be, add one of the following options, which represent the
         same adjustment, to the stamp's data file. (An equals sign, "=", may
         be included after the word "scale".)

           * "scale 40%"
           * "scale 5/2"
           * "scale 2.5"
           * "scale 2:5"

    Windows Users

         Use NotePad or WordPad to edit/create these files. Be sure to save
         them as plain-text, and make sure they have a ".txt" extension at
         the end of the filename.

  Pre-Mirrored and Flipped Stamps

       In some cases, you may wish to provide a pre-drawn version of a
       stamp's mirror-image, flipped image, or even both. For example,
       imagine a picture of a fire truck with the words "Fire Department"
       written across the side. You probably do not want that text to appear
       backwards when the image is flipped!

       To create a mirrored version of a stamp that you want Tux Paint to
       use, rather than mirroring one on its own, simply create a second
       ".png" or ".svg" graphics file with the same name, except with
       "_mirror" before the filename extension.

       For example, for the stamp "stamp.png" you would create another file
       named "stamp_mirror.png", which will be used when the stamp is
       mirrored (rather than using a backwards version of "stamp.png").

       As of Tux Paint 0.9.18, you may similarly provide a pre-flipped image
       with "_flip" in the name, and/or an image that is both mirrored and
       flipped, by naming it "_mirror_flip".

       Note: If the user flips and mirrors an image, and a pre-drawn
       "_mirror_flip" doesn't exist, but either "_flip" or "_mirror" does, it
       will be used, and mirrored or flipped, respectively.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fonts

     The fonts used by Tux Paint are TrueType Fonts (TTF).

     Simply place them in the "fonts" directory. Tux Paint will load the font
     and provide four different sizes in the 'Letters' selector when using
     the 'Text' and 'Label' tools.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

'Starters'

     'Starter' images appear in the 'New' dialog, along with solid color
     background choices.

     When you use a 'starter' image, make modifications, and save it, the
     original 'starter' image is not overwritten. Additionally, as you edit
     your new picture, the contents of the original 'starter' can affect it.

  Coloring-Book Style Starters

       The most basic kind of 'starter' is similar to a picture in a coloring
       book. It's an outline of a shape which you can then color in and add
       details to. In Tux Paint, as you draw, type text, or stamp stamps, the
       outline remains 'above' what you draw. You can erase the parts of the
       drawing you made, but you can't erase the outline.

       To create this kind of 'starter' image, simply create an outlined
       black and white picture in a paint program, and save it as a raster
       PNG file, or vector SVG. If saving as a PNG, you may optionally render
       the image as black-and-transparent, rather than black-and-white, but
       (as of Tux Paint 0.9.21) this is not required.

  Scene-Style Starters

       Along with the 'coloring-book' style overlay, you can also provide a
       separate background image as part of a 'starter' picture. The overlay
       acts the same: it can't be drawn over, erased, or affected by 'Magic'
       tools. However, the background can be!

       When the 'Eraser' tool is used on a picture based on this kind of
       'starter' image, rather than turning the canvas to a solid color, such
       as white, it returns that part of the canvas to the original
       background picture from the 'starter' image.

       By creating both an overlay and a background, you can create a
       'starter' which simulates depth. Imagine a background that shows the
       ocean, and an overlay that's a picture of a reef. You can then draw
       (or stamp) fish in the picture. They'll appear in the ocean, but never
       'in front of' the reef.

       To create this kind of 'starter' picture, simply create an overlay
       (with transparency) and save it as a PNG. Then create another image
       (without transparency), and save it with the same filename, but with
       "-back" (short for 'background') appended to the name. (e.g.,
       "starter-back.png" would be the background ocean picture that
       corresponds to the overlay, or foreground.)

     For best results, 'starter' images should be at least the same size as
     Tux Paint's drawing canvas. (See the "Loading Other Pictures into Tux
     Paint" section of Tux Paint's main documentation (README) for details on
     sizing.) If they are not, they will be stretched or scaled. This is done
     without affecting the shape ("aspect ratio"); however some smudging may
     be applied to the edges.

     Place them in the "starters" directory. When the 'New' dialog is
     accessed in Tux Paint, the 'starter' images will appear in the screen
     that appears, after the various solid color choices.

     Note: 'Starters' are 'attached' to saved pictures, via a small text file
     that has the same name as the saved file, but with ".dat" as the
     extension. This allows it to continue to affect the drawing even after
     Tux Paint has been quit, or another picture is loaded or a new image is
     created. (In other words, if you base a drawing on a 'starter' image, it
     will always be affected by it.)

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

'Templates'

     'Template' images also appear in the 'New' dialog, along with solid
     color background choices and 'Starters'. (Note: Tux Paint prior to
     version 0.9.22 did not have the 'Template' feature.)

     Unlike pictures drawn in Tux Paint by users and then opened later,
     opening a 'template' creates a new drawing. When you save, the
     'template' image is not overwritten. Unlike 'starters', there is no
     immutable 'layer' above the canvas. You may draw over any part of it.

     When the 'Eraser' tool is used on a picture based on this kind of
     'template' image, rather than turning the canvas to a solid color, such
     as white, it returns that part of the canvas to the original background
     picture from the 'template' image.

     'Templates' are simply image files (in PNG, JPEG, SVG, or KPX (KidPix)
     format). No preparation or conversion should be required.

     For best results, 'template' images should be at least the same size as
     Tux Paint's drawing canvas. (See the "Loading Other Pictures into Tux
     Paint" section of Tux Paint's main documentation (README) for details on
     sizing.) If they are not, they will be stretched or scaled. This is done
     without affecting the shape ("aspect ratio"); however some smudging may
     be applied to the edges.

     Place them in the "templates" directory. When the 'New' dialog is
     accessed in Tux Paint, the 'template' images will appear in the screen
     that appears, after the various solid color choices.

     Note: 'Templates' are 'attached' to saved pictures, via a small text
     file that has the same name as the saved file, but with ".dat" as the
     extension. This allows it to continue to affect the drawing even after
     Tux Paint has been quit, or another picture is loaded or a new image is
     created. (In other words, if you base a drawing on a 'template' image,
     it will always be affected by it.)

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Translations

     Tux Paint supports numerous languages, thanks to use of the "gettext"
     localization library. (See "Options documentation" for how to change
     locales in Tux Paint.)

     To translate Tux Paint to a new language, copy the translation template
     file, "tuxpaint.pot" (found in Tux Paint's source code, in the folder
     "src/po/"). Rename the copy as a ".po" file, with an appropriate name
     for the locale you're translating to (e.g., "es.po" for Spanish; or
     "pt_BR.po" for Brazilian Portuguese, versus "pt.po" or "pt_PT.po" for
     Portuguese spoken in Portugal.)

     Open the newly-created ".po" file — you can edit in a plain text edtior,
     such as Emacs, Pico or VI on Linux, or NotePad on Windows. The original
     English text used in Tux Paint is listed in lines starting with "msgid".
     Enter your translations of each of these pieces of text in the empty
     "msgstr" lines directly below the corresponding "msgid" lines. (Note: Do
     not remove the quotes.)

     Example:

       msgid "Smudge"
       msgstr "Manchar"

       msgid "Click and drag to draw large bricks."
       msgstr "Haz clic y arrastra para dibujar ladrillos grandes."

     Various tools exist to manage gettext translation catalogs, so you don't
     have to edit them by hand in a text editor. Here are a few:

       * Poedit
       * Gtranslator (GNOME Translator)
       * Virtraal
       * Lokalize

     Note: It is best to always work off of the latest Tux Paint text catalog
     template ("tuxpaint.pot"), since new text is added, and old text is
     occasionally changed. The text catalog for the upcoming, unreleased
     version of Tux Paint can be found in Tux Paint's Git repository (see:
     http://www.tuxpaint.org/download/source/git/), and on the Tux Paint
     website at http://www.tuxpaint.org/help/po/.

     To edit an existing translation, download the latest ".po" file for that
     language, and edit it as described above.

     You may send new or edited translation files to Bill Kendrick, lead
     developer of Tux Paint, at: bill@newbreedsoftware.com, or post them to
     the "tuxpaint-i18n" mailing list (see: http://www.tuxpaint.org/lists/).

     Alternatively, if you have an account with SourceForge.net, you can
     request to be added to the "tuxpaint" project and receive write-access
     to the Git source code repository so that you may commit your changes
     directly.

     Note: Support for new locales requires making additions to Tux Paint's
     source code ("/src/i18n.h" and "/src/i18n.c"), and requires updates to
     the Makefile, to ensure the ".po" files are compiled into ".mo" files,
     and available for use at runtime.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Alternative Input Methods

     Tux Paint's 'Text' and 'Label' tools can provide alternative input
     methods for some languages. For example, when Tux Paint is running with
     a Japanese locale, the right [Alt] key can be pressed to cycle between
     Latin, Romanized Hiragana and Romanized Katakana modes. This allows
     native characters and words to be entered into the 'Text' and 'Label'
     tools by typing one or more keys on a keyboard with Latin characters
     (e.g., a US QWERTY keyboard).

     To create an input method for a new locale, create a text file with a
     name based on the locale (e.g., "ja" for Japanese), with ".im" as the
     extension (e.g., "ja.im").

     The ".im" file can have multiple character mapping sections for
     different character mapping modes. For example, on a Japanese typing
     system, typing [K] [A] in Hiragana mode generates a different Unicode
     character ("か") than typing [K] [A] in Katakana mode ("カ").

     List the character mappings in this file, one per line. Each line should
     contain (separated by whitespace):

       * the Unicode value of the character, in hexadecimal (more than one
         character can be listed, separated by a colon (':'), this allowing
         some sequences to map to words)
       * the keycode sequence (the ASCII characters that must be entered to
         generate the Unicode character)
       * a flag (or "-" if none)

     Start additional character mapping sections with a line containign the
     word "section".

     Example:

       # Hiragana
       304B ka -
       304C ga -
       304D ki -
       304E gi -
       304D:3083 kya -
       3063:305F tta -

       # Katakana
       section
       30AB ka -
       30AC ga -
       30AD ki -
       30AE gi -

     Note: Blank lines within the ".im" file will be ignored, as will any
     text following a "#" (pound/hash) character — it can be used to denote
     comments, as seen in the example above.

     Note: Meanings of the flags are locale-specific, and are processed by
     the language-specific source code in "src/im.c". For example, "b" is
     used in Korean to handle Batchim, which may carry over to the next
     character.

     Note: Support for new input methods requires making additions to Tux
     Paint's source code ("/src/im.c"), and requires updates to the Makefile,
     to ensure the ".im" files are available for use at runtime.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

On-screen Keyboard

     As of version 0.9.22, Tux Paint's 'Text' and 'Label' tools can present
     an on-screen keyboard that allows the pointer (via a mouse, eye-tracking
     systems, etc.) to be used to input characters. Files that describe the
     layout and available keys are stored in Tux Paint "osk" directory. Each
     keyboard layout is defined by a number of files (some of which may be
     shared by different layouts).

     We'll use the QWERTY keyboard as an example:

  Layout overview file ("qwerty.layout")

       This is a text file that specifies the other files used to describe
       the layout and key mappings.

         layout qwerty.h_layout
         keymap us-intl-altgr-dead-keys.keymap
         composemap en_US.UTF-8_Compose
         keysymdefs keysymdef.h
         keyboardlist qwerty.layout default.layout

       Note: Blank lines within the ".layout" file will be ignored, as will
       any text following a "#" (pound/hash) character — it can be used to
       denote comments, as seen in the example above.

       The "keyboardlist" line describes which layouts to switch to, when the
       user clicks the left and right buttons on the keyboard. (See below.)

  Keyboard layout file ("qwerty.h_layout")

       This describes how big the keyboard is (as a "width × height" grid),
       and lists each key with its numeric keycode (see the "keymap" file,
       below), the width it should be drawn at (typically "1.0", to take one
       space on the keyboard, but in the example below, notice the "TAB" and
       "SPACE" keys are much wider), the character or text to display on the
       key, depending on which modifier keys have been pressed (one each for:
       no modifiers, [Shift], [AltGr], and [Shift] + [AltGr]), and finally
       whether or not the key is affected by the [CapsLock] key (use "1") or
       [AltGr] (alternate graphics) key (use "2"), or not at all (use "0").

         WIDTH 15
         HEIGHT 5

         KEY 49 1.0 ` ~ ` ~ 0
         KEY 10 1.0 1 ! ¡ ¹ 0

         KEY 24 1.0 q Q ä Ä 1
         KEY 25 1.0 w W å Å 1
         KEY 26 1.0 e E é É 1
         KEY 27 1.0 r R ® ® 1
         ...

         NEWLINE

         # Arrow to left will change to the previous keyboard
         KEY 2 1.0 <- <- <- <- 0

         KEY 133 2.0 Cmp Cmp Cmp Cmp 0

         # The ALT or ALTGR keys are used in im to switch the input mode
         KEY 64 2.0 Alt Alt Alt Alt 0

         # Space
         KEY 65 7.0 SPACE SPACE SPACE SPACE 0

         KEY 108 2.0 AltGr AltGr AltGr AltGr 0

         # Arrow to right will change to the next keyboard
         KEY 1 1.0 -> -> -> -> 0

       Notice here that alphabetic keys ([Q], [W], etc.) will be affected by
       [CapsLock], while numeric keys ([1], [2], etc.), [Space], and so on,
       will not.

       Keycodes up to "8" are reserved for internal use. The ones currently
       used are described below.

         * 0 — empty button
         * 1 — next layout (per the layout file's "keyboardlist" setting)
         * 2 — previous layout (per the layout file's "keyboardlist" setting)

  Keymap file ("us-intl-altgr-dead-keys.keymap")

       This file defines which numeric keycodes (seen in the keyboard layout
       files, such as "qwerty.h_layout" described above) should be mapped to
       which actual characters that an application such as Tux Paint expects
       to receive when keys (e.g., on a real keyboard) are pressed.

       If you're using an operating system such as Linux, which runs X-Window
       and has the "xmodmap" command-line tool available, you can run it with
       the ("print keymap expressions" option, "-pke", to generate a keymap
       file.

  Composemap file ("en_US.UTF-8_Compose")

       This file describes single characters that can be composed by multiple
       inputs. For example, "[Compose]" followed by "[A]" and "[E]" can be
       used to create the "æ" character.

       The file that comes with Tux Paint is based on the US English UTF-8
       (Unicode) composemap that comes with X.Org's X Window system. The
       current version from the Xlib library has a web located page at
       https://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/libX11/i18n/compose/en_US.UTF-8.html.

  Keysym definitions file ("keysymdef.h")

       This file (which is a C programming language header file) is also from
       the X Window System. It defines the Unicode values of each keycap
       (e.g., "XK_equal" corresponds to "U+003D", for the character "="
       ("EQUALS SIGN").

       Note: This file is not compiled into Tux Paint, but is read and parsed
       at runtime.

       It is unlikely that any modification will be required of this file.
