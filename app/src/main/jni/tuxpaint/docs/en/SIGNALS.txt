     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Tux Paint responds to the following signals (which can be sent to the
   program's process via `kill` or `killall`, for example).

   SIGTERM (also, [Ctrl] + [C] from a terminal running `tuxpaint`)

           Tux Paint responds as if the "Quit" button were pressed, or the
           desktop environment was told to close Tux Paint (e.g., by clicking
           a window close button, or pressing [Alt] + [F4] on most systems).

           From the main interface, Tux Paint will prompt whether or not you
           wish to quit, and (unless overridden by the auto-save option, e.g.
           "--autosave") if you'd like to save the current drawing (if
           unsaved), and if so, and it's a modified version of an existing
           drawing (unless overridden by the options to save over old images,
           or always save new images; e.g. "--saveover" and "--saveovernew",
           respectively), whether or not to overwrite the existing drawing,
           or save to a new file.

           Note: From other parts of the interface, the signal is currently
           interpreted as a request to go back (e.g., from the "New" dialog
           back to the main interface), as if a "Back" button in Tux Paint
           were clicked, or the [Esc] was key pressed.

           Example: killall tuxpaint

   SIGUSR1 & SIGUSR2

           Tux Paint responds by setting its auto-save option (as if it had
           been launched with "--autosave"), as well as either the option to
           always save new images (as if launched with "--saveovernew") in
           the case of receiving a SIGUSR1 signal, or to always save over the
           existing image (as if launched with "--saveover") in the case of
           receiving SIGUSR2. Then Tux Paint sends itself a SIGTERM signal,
           in an attempt to quit. (See above.)

           So, from the main interface, Tux Paint should quit almost
           immediately, with no questions asked.

           Note: From other parts of the interface, unfortunately, Tux Paint
           will go back one level in the interface. Therefore, at this time,
           it may be necessary to send this signal to Tux Paint a few times,
           for it to quit completely.

           Example: killall -s SIGUSR1 tuxpaint
