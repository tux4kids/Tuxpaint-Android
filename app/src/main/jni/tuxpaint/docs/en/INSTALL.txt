Requirements

Simple DirectMedia Layer library (libSDL)

Tux Paint requires the Simple DirectMedia Layer Library (libSDL), an Open
Source multimedia programming library available under the GNU Lesser General
Public License (LGPL).

Along with libSDL, Tux Paint depends on a number of other SDL 'helper'
libraries: SDL_Image (for graphics files), SDL_gfx (for some graphical
functions, like rotation), SDL_TTF and SDL2_Pango (for True Type Font support)
and, optionally, SDL_Mixer (for sound effects).

The SDL libraries are available as source-code, or as RPM or Debian packages
for various distributions of Linux. They can be downloaded from:

  * libSDL: http://www.libsdl.org/
  * SDL_image: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image
  * SDL_gfx: https://www.ferzkopp.net/wordpress/2016/01/02/sdl_gfx-sdl2_gfx/ (
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/sdlgfx/)
  * SDL_ttf: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf
  * SDL2_Pango: https://github.com/markuskimius/SDL2_Pango
  * SDL_mixer: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer (optional)

They are also typically available along with your Linux distribution (e.g. on
an installation media, or available via package maintainance software like
Debian's "apt").

💡 Note: When installing libraries from packages, be sure to ALSO install the
development versions of the packages. (For example, install both
"SDL2-2.24.0.rpm" and "SDL2-devel-2.24.0.rpm".)

Other Libraries

Tux Paint also takes advantage of a number of other free, LGPL'd libraries.
Under Linux, just like SDL, they should either already be installed, or are
readily available for installation as part of your Linux distribution.

libPNG

    Tux Paint uses PNG (Portable Network Graphics) format for its data files.
    SDL_image will require libPNG be installed.

    http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html



gettext

    Tux Paint uses your system's locale settings along with the "gettext"
    library to support various languages (e.g., Spanish). You'll need the
    gettext library installed.

    http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/



libpaper (Linux/Unix only)

    As of Tux Paint 0.9.17, Tux Paint can determine your system's default paper
    size (e.g., A4 or Letter), or can be told to use a particular paper size,
    thanks to "libpaper".

    https://github.com/naota/libpaper



FriBiDi

    Tux Paint's "Text" and also "Label" tools support bidirectional languages,
    thanks to the "FriBiDi" library.

    http://fribidi.org/



SVG graphics support

    As of Tux Paint 0.9.17, Tux Paint can load SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
    images as stamps. Two sets of libraries are supported, and SVG support can
    be completely disabled (via "make SVG_LIB:=")

    librsvg-2 & libCairo2 (newer libraries)
          o libRSVG 2: http://librsvg.sourceforge.net/
          o Cairo 2: http://www.cairographics.org/
          o These also depend on the following:
              # GdkPixbuf & GLib: http://www.gtk.org/
              # Pango: http://www.pango.org/


    Older SVG libraries
          o libcairo1, libsvg1, & libsvg-cairo1: http://www.cairographics.org/
          o These also depend on the following:
              # libxml2: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2





Animated GIF Export feature

    To support export of animated GIFs (slideshows), the "libimagequant"
    library (from the "pngquant2" project) is required.

    https://github.com/ImageOptim/libimagequant



NetPBM Tools (optional) No longer used, by default

    📜 Under Linux and Unix, earlier versions of Tux Paint used the NetPBM tools
    to assist with printing. (A PNG is generated by Tux Paint, and converted
    into a PostScript using the 'pngtopnm' and 'pnmtops' NetPBM command-line
    tools.)

    http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/




Compiling and Installation

Tux Paint is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) (see
"COPYING.txt" for details), and therefore the 'source code' to the program is
available freely.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows

Compiling Set-Up

As of February 2005 (starting with Tux Paint 0.9.15), the "Makefile" includes
support for building on a Windows system using MinGW/MSYS (https://
sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/).

Many tools and libraries are required to build Tux Paint. The package
management system "pacman" helps you install them automatically solving
complicated dependencies.

MYSYS2

Download the latest MSYS2 environment from https://www.msys2.org/ and install
it where you'd like (the default is "C:\msys64")

Open the MSYS2 shell from the "Start Menu" → "MSYS2 64bit" → "MSYS2 MSYS" and
execute following command:

    $ yes "" | pacman -Syu

This will update core system and the window will close automatically. Open the
msys2 shell again and execute following command to finish remaining updating
process.

    $ yes "" | pacman -Syu

Within the MSYS2 shell, run the following command to install basic development
tools:

    $ yes "" | pacman -S make automake-wrapper autoconf-wrapper libtool git zip
    patch gperf dos2unix

Proceed to the next "MinGW 64bit (x86_64) toolchains" section, or skip to the "
MinGW 32bit (i686) toolchains" section if you need only a 32bit build
environment.

          -----------------------------------------------------------

MinGW 64bit (x86_64) compiler and tools

Within the MSYS2 shell, run the following command to install 64bit compiler and
basic development tools:

    $ yes "" | pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-{gcc,pkgconf,ntldd-git}

"ntldd" is a small tool which examine windows executable files to list Dynamic
Link Library (.dll) files they depends on. Tux Paint's packaging process for
binary distribution uses it to find required .dll files.

64bit (x86_64) dependency libraries for Tux Paint and Tux Paint Config

You can install tools and libraries required for compiling Tux Paint and Tux
Paint Config on MSYS2/MINGW using "pacman" except for SDL2_Pango and
libunibreak.

FLTK is a cross-platform GUI toolkit used by "Tux Paint Config". You can skip
installing it if you are only building "Tux Paint".

    $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL_{image,ttf,gfx}
    $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-{librsvg,fribidi,libimagequant,fltk}

💡 Note: Close the shell before proceeding to the remaining process.

Install SDL2_Pango and libunibreak on the 64bit environment

SDL2_Pango and libunibreak should be installed manually.

This time, use the MinGW "64bit" shell. Open the shell from the "Start Menu" →
"MSYS2 64bit" → "MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit"

SDL2_Pango

You can fetch the source code from the Mark K. Kim's git repositry, compile and
install it as follows.

    $ git clone https://github.com/markuskimius/SDL2_Pango
    $ cd SDL2_Pango
    $ ./configure --prefix=/mingw64 && make && make install

libunibreak

libunibreak is required for compiling Tux Paint Config. You can skip installing
it if you are only building "Tux Paint".

You can fetch the source code from the git repositry and compile it as follows.

    $ git clone https://github.com/adah1972/libunibreak libunibreak
    $ cd libunibreak
    $ ./augogen.sh --prefix=/mingw64 && make && make install

Proceed to the next "MinGW 32bit (i686) toolchains" section, or skip to the "
ImageMagick" section if you need only a 64bit build environment.

          -----------------------------------------------------------

MinGW 32bit (i686) compiler and tools

Within the MSYS2 shell, run the following command to install 32bit compiler and
basic development tools:

    $ yes "" | pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-{gcc,pkgconf,ntldd-git}

"ntldd" is a small tool which examine windows executable files to list Dynamic
Link Library (.dll) files they depends on. Tux Paint's packaging process for
binary distribution uses it to find required .dll files.

32bit (i686) dependency libraries for Tux Paint and Tux Paint Config

You can install tools and libraries required for compiling Tux Paint and Tux
Paint Config on MSYS2/MINGW using "pacman" except for SDL2_Pango and
libunibreak.

FLTK is a cross-platform GUI toolkit used by "Tux Paint Config". You can skip
installing it if you are only building "Tux Paint".

    $ pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-SDL_{image,ttf,gfx}
    $ pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-{librsvg,fribidi,libimagequant,fltk}

💡 Note: Close the shell before proceeding to the remaining process.

Install SDL2_Pango and libunibreak on the 32bit environment

SDL2_Pango and libunibreak should be installed manually.

This time, use the MinGW "32bit" shell. Open the shell from the "Start Menu" →
"MSYS2 64bit" → "MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit"

SDL2_Pango

You can fetch the source code from the Mark K. Kim's git repositry, compile and
install it as follows.

    $ git clone https://github.com/markuskimius/SDL2_Pango
    $ cd SDL2_Pango
    $ ./configure --prefix=/mingw32 && make && make install

libunibreak

libunibreak is required for compiling Tux Paint Config. You can skip installing
it if you are only building "Tux Paint".

You can fetch the source code from the git repositry and compile it as follows.

    $ git clone https://github.com/adah1972/libunibreak libunibreak
    $ cd libunibreak
    $ ./augogen.sh --prefix=/mingw32 && make && make install

ImageMagick

ImageMagick is a compilation of command line tools to create, edit, compose, or
convert bitmap images supporting quite a large number of image formats. Tux
Paint uses two functions ("convert" and "composite") in it to generate
thumbnails for startar images and templates during the build process.

Using official binary release available from "Windows Binary Release" is
recommended, due to the commands installed with "pacman" on MinGW/MSYS not
working as expected!

Do not forget to enable "Install legacy utilities (e.g. convert)" while
installing it, because Tux Paint's build process uses them.

Add the path to the directory in which ImageMagick is installed at the top of
your "PATH" environment variable. For example:

    $ export PATH=/c/Program\ Files/ImageMagick-7.0.10-Q16-HDRI:$PATH

You can make this permanent by adding the above to your the BASH shell
configuration file, "~/.bash_profile".

Tux Paint & Tux Paint Config.

You can compile 64-bit binaries using "MSYS2 64bit" shell, and 32-bit binaries
using "MSYS2 32bit" shell, respectively.

  * Select "MSYS2 64bit" → "MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit" from the "Start Menu" to open
    the 64bit shell.
  * Select "MSYS2 64bit" → "MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit" from the "Start Menu" to open
    the 32bit shell.

Tux Paint Config.

"Tux Paint Config" is a useful graphical tool for tweaking Tux Paint's
behavior. You have to build this component before compiling Tux Paint if you
want to have it included in your package.

You can use either (a) a stable tar-ball release, or (b) the developing source
tree.

 a. Using stable tar-ball release:
      + Download a source tar-ball
      + Expand the tar-ball and change the directory name so that the final
        packaging process can find related files.

            $ tar zxvf tuxpaint-config-A.B.C.tar.gz
            $ mv tuxpaint-config-A.B.C tuxpaint-config

 b. Using the developing source tree:
      + Fetch the developing source tree from git repository:

            $ git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/tuxpaint/tuxpaint-config
            tuxpaint-config

Now you can build Tux Paint Config. as follows:

    $ cd tuxpaint-config
    $ make win32

Tux Paint

You can use either (a) a stable tar-ball release, or (b) the developing source
tree.

 a. Using stable tar-ball release:
      + Download a source tar-ball
      + Expand the tar-ball and change the directory name so that the final
        packaging process can find related files.

            $ tar zxvf tuxpaint-A.B.C.tar.gz
            $ mv tuxpaint-A.B.C tuxpaint

 b. Using the developing source tree:
      + Fetch the developing source tree from git repository:

            $ git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/tuxpaint/tuxpaint tuxpaint

Now you can build Tux Paint as follows:

    $ cd tuxpaint
    $ make bdist-win32

All the files needed for starting Tux Paint (and Tux Paint Config.) are
collected in the directory for binary distribution "bdist" directory under
"win32". You can start them by double-clicking their executable (.exe) files in
the "bdist" directory.

Building the Tux Paint Windows Installer

Inno Setup is used to build executable installer for Tux Paint. Therefore you
have to install it in the first place.

Inno Setup officially supports translations for only about 20 languages.
However, one of the great points of Tux Paint is it supports so many languages.
Therefore, the set up script "tuxpaint.iss" to build the installer is written
to use much more translations including unofficial one which are available on "
Inno Setup Translations". You have to download translation files (.isl)
required and put them in "Languages" directory under the directory in which
Inno Setup is installed.

Before building an installer, edit the "tuxpaint.iss" file and enable one of
the lines starting with "#define BuildTarget=", depending on the architecture
of the installer you want to create.

Then, you can easily build an executable installer by right-clicking on the
"tuxpaint.iss" icon in the "win32" directory and selecting "Compile" on the
list. It will run for a while, and eventually you will find a "tuxpaint-X.Y.Z
-windows-<arch>-installer.exe" file in the same directory.

Running the Tux Paint Windows Installer

Double-click the Tux Paint installer executable (.EXE file) and follow the
instructions.

First, you will be asked to read the license. (It is the GNU General Public
License (GPL), which is also available as "COPYING.txt".)

You will then be asked whether you want to install shortcuts to Tux Paint in
your Windows Start Menu and on your Windows Desktop. (Both options are set by
default.)

Then you will be asked where you wish to install Tux Paint. The default should
be suitable, as long as there is space available. Otherwise, pick a different
location.

At this point, you can click 'Install' to install Tux Paint!

Changing the Settings Using the Shortcut

To change program settings, right-click on the TuxPaint shortcut and select
'Properties' (at the bottom).

Make sure the 'Shortcut' tab is selected in the window that appears, and
examine the 'Target:' field. You should see something like this:

    "C:\Program Files\TuxPaint\TuxPaint.exe"

You can now add command-line options which will be enabled when you
double-click the icon.

For example, to make the game run in fullscreen mode, with simple shapes (no
rotation option) and in French, add the options (after 'TuxPaint.exe'), like
so:

    "C:\Program Files\TuxPaint\TuxPaint.exe" -f -s --lang french

(See the main documentation for a full list of available command-line options.)

If you make a mistake or it all disappears use [Control] + [Z] to undo or just
hit the [Esc] key and the box will close with no changes made (unless you
pushed the "Apply" button!).

When you have finished, click "OK."

If Something Goes Wrong

If, when you double-click on the shortcut to run Tux Paint, nothing happens, it
is probably because some of these command-line options are wrong. Open an
Explorer, and look for a file called "stderr.txt" in your personal saving
folder for TuxPaint which is normaly "C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\
TuxPaint".

It will contain a description of what was wrong. Usually it will just be due to
incorrect character-case (capital 'Z' instead of lowercase 'z') or a missing
(or extra) '-' (dash).

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Linux/Unix

Compiling:

💡 Note: Tux Paint does not use autoconf/automake, so there is no "./configure"
script to run. Compiling should be straight-forward though, assuming everything
Tux Paint needs is installed.

To compile the program from source, simply run the following command from a
shell prompt (e.g., "$"):

    $ make

Disabling SVG support (and hence Cairo, libSVG, and svg-cairo dependencies):

To disable SVG support (e.g., if your system is not currently supported by the
Cairo library or other SVG-related dependencies), you can run "make" with
"SVG_LIB= SVG_CFLAGS= NOSVGFLAG=NOSVG" added:

    $ make SVG_LIB= SVG_CFLAGS=

Disabling Sound at Compile-time

If you don't have a sound card, or would prefer to build the program with no
sound support (and therefore without a the SDL_mixer dependency), you can run
"make" with "SDL_MIXER_LIB=" added:

    $ make SDL_MIXER_LIB=

Other options

Various other options (e.g., installation paths) may be overridden; see them in
"Makefile" for further details.

If you get errors

If you receive any errors during compile-time, make sure you have the
appropriate libraries installed (see above). If using packaged versions of the
libraries (e.g., RPMs under RedHat or DEBs under Debian), be sure to get the
corresponding "-dev" or "-devel" packages as well, otherwise you won't be able
to compile Tux Paint (and other programs) from source!

Installng

Assuming no fatal errors occured, you can now install the program so that it
can be run by users on the system. By default, this must be done by the "root"
user ('superuser'). Switch to "root" by typing the command:

    $ su

Enter "root"'s password at the prompt. You should now be "root" (with a prompt
like "#"). To install the program and its data files, type:

    # make install

Finally, you can switch back to your regular user by exiting superuser mode:

    # exit

Alternatively, you may be able to simply use the "sudo" command (e.g., on
Ubuntu Linux):

    $ sudo make install

💡 Note: By default, "tuxpaint", the executable program, is placed in "/usr/
local/bin/". The data files (images, sounds, etc.) are placed in "/usr/local/
share/tuxpaint/".

Changing Where Things Go

You can change where things will go by setting "Makefile"variables on the
command line. "DESTDIR" is used to place output in a staging area for package
creation. "PREFIX" is the basis of where all other files go, and is, by
default, set to "/usr/local".

Other variables are:

BIN_PREFIX
    Where the "tuxpaint" binary will be installed. (Set to "$(PREFIX)/bin" by
    default - e.g., "/usr/local/bin")

DATA_PREFIX
    Where the data files (sound, graphics, brushes, stamps, fonts) will go, and
    where Tux Paint will look for them when it's run. (Set to "$(PREFIX)/share/
    tuxpaint")

DOC_PREFIX
    Where the documentation text files (the "docs" directory) will go. (Set to
    "$(PREFIX)/share/doc/tuxpaint")

MAN_PREFIX
    Where the manual page for Tux Paint will go. (Set to "$(PREFIX)/share/man")

ICON_PREFIX — $(PREFIX)/share/pixmaps
X11_ICON_PREFIX — $(PREFIX)/X11R6/include/X11/pixmaps
GNOME_PREFIX — $(PREFIX)/share/gnome/apps/Graphics
KDE_PREFIX — $(PREFIX)/share/applnk/Graphics
    Where the icons and launchers (for GNOME and KDE) will go.

LOCALE_PREFIX
    Where the translation files for Tux Paint will go, and where Tux Paint will
    look for them. (Set to "$(PREFIX)/share/locale/") (Final location of a
    translation file will be under the locale's directory (e.g., "es" for
    Spanish), within the "LC_MESSAGES" subdirectory.)


💡 Note: This list is out of date. See "Makefile" and "Makefile-i18n" for a
complete list.

macOS

June 5, 2022 Mark Kim <markuskimius@gmail.com>

Starting with Tux Paint 0.9.23, Tux Paint for macOS is built as though it were
a Linux application.

Prerequisites

Although Tux Paint is built without the Xcode IDE, Xcode itself is still
required to build Tux Paint. Download it from the App Store, and launch it once
to accept its license agreements. You may also need to install the Xcode
command line tools using the command:

    $ xcode-select --install

Building Tux Paint also requires various libraries. We install them from
MacPorts where possible, source code otherwise. Install MacPorts to the default
/opt/local path according to the instructions found on their website: https://
www.macports.org/

  * ImageMagick
  * cairo
  * fribidi
  * lbzip2
  * libimagequant^*
  * libpaper
  * libpng
  * librsvg
  * libsdl2
  * libsdl2_image
  * libsdl2_mixer
  * libsdl2_pango^*
  * libsdl2_ttf
  * libsdl2_gfx
  * pkgconfig
  * zlib

... but you should install any package that is required by the latest version
of Tux Paint.

^* Not available from MacPorts as of this writing, see below.

libimagequant

libimagequant is not available from MacPorts as of this writing. It can be
installed from the source code as follows. It should be installed to /opt/local
(same as MacPorts) for the library to be included in TuxPaint.dmg.

    $ sudo port install rust cargo
    $ git clone https://github.com/ImageOptim/libimagequant.git
    $ cd libimagequant/imagequant-sys
    $ cargo build --release # Must use cargo from MacPorts
    $ sudo make PREFIX=/opt/local install

sdl2_pango

sdl2_pango is not available from MacPorts as of this writing. It can be
installed from the source code as follows. It should be installed to /opt/local
(same as MacPorts) for the library to be included in TuxPaint.dmg.

    $ git clone https://github.com/markuskimius/SDL2_Pango.git
    $ cd SDL2_Pango
    $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/local && make && sudo make install

WARNING: Having any UNIX-like toolset installed on your Mac besides MacPorts
and Xcode, such as Fink or Brew, will prevent your app bundle from being
portable. Be sure Fink and Brew are not accessible from your build environment.

How to Build

Simply, run:

    % make
    % make install

... to create the TuxPaint.app application bundle that can be run in-place or
copied to /Applications. To create the DMG file for distribution, use 'make
TuxPaint.dmg'.

Additional steps are required when building a Unviersal Binary. See "Building a
Universal Binary" below.

Known Issues

  * A macOS binary built on a specific version of macOS only runs on that
    version of macOS or later. To ensure Tux Paint can run on the oldest
    version of macOS possible, build it on the oldest version of macOS
    available. As of this writing we know Tux Paint cannot be built to run on
    macOS 10.7 or earlier.

    See "Old Versions of macOS" below for best-effort instructions on how to
    obtain, install, and build Tux Paint on an old version of macOS.

    Alternatively, Tux Paint and all of its library dependencies may be
    compiled with appropriate options to be runnable on older versions of
    macOS. These options are already set on Tux Paint, so only its dependencies
    (from MacPorts) need to be recompiled. See "Recompiling MacPorts" below for
    the instructions.

Old Versions of macOS

Some old versions of macOS can be downloaded from Apple's support page: https:/
/support.apple.com/en-us/HT211683

macOS for Intel CPU does allow dual booting of multiple versions of the OS, but
it's safer and easier to install the old macOS onto a flash drive. Wherever
you're installing it, the target drive's partitioniong scheme and partition
type must match what the old macOS expects, so use the Disk Utility to
partition and format the flash drive accordingly.

Dual booting multiple versions of macOS for Apple Silicon has been so far
unsuccessful. Instead of installing an older version of macOS for Apple Silicon
to build Tux Paint to run on the old version of macOS for Apple Silicon, use
the instructions found in the "Recompiling MacPorts" section to build Tux Paint
to run on older versions of macOS for Apple Silicon.

As of this writing, the oldest version of macOS available on Apple's support
site is Yosemite 10.10, which expects "GPT (GUID Partition Table)" partitioning
scheme instead of the older MBR scheme, and "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)" as
the partition type instead of the newer APFS partition type.

Upon launching the installer, if you get a popup about macOS being too old or
new to be installed, a bootable installer can be created using the instructions
found here: https://support.apple.com/en-mide/HT201372

Once the old macOS is installed, you may find the Xcode on the App Store is too
new to run on the version of the old macOS. Old versions of Xcode can be
downloaded from Apple's Developer site in an area accessible with free
registration: https://developer.apple.com/download/more/

The list of macOS versions and the last version of Xcode compatible with them
are laid out nicely on the Wikipedia page on Xcode: https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Xcode#Version_comparison_table

And because Xcode is being installed manually, you can skip the step to install
the Xcode command line tools (do not run "xcode-select --install") but
otherwise build Tux Paint using the same steps described in the earlier part of
this document.

Recompiling MacPorts

To recompile MacPorts to be usable on older versions of macOS, set the
following options in /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf:

    buildfromsource always
    macosx_deployment_target 10.10

Then uninstall all MacPorts packages:

    $ sudo port -fp uninstall installed

Then reinstall all MacPorts packages needed by Tux Paint. Also rebuild
libimagequant using the updated Cargo package from MacPorts.

As of this writing, all libraries Tux Paint requires from MacPorts can be
recompiled in this manner to run on macOS 10.10 Yosemite and later on Intel
CPUs, and macOS 11.0 Big Sur and later on Apple Silicon. Unfortunately,
although MacPorts has the option to enable the building of universal libraries,
several libraries Tux Paint require cannot be built as universal libraries so
they can only be built to run natively on the hardware on which they were
built. See "Building a Universal Binary" below for instructions on how to build
Tux Paint as a Universal Binary.

Building a Universal Binary

To build Tux Paint as a Universal Binary, compile Tux Paint for the Intel CPU
and the Apple Silicon separately first. Then rename the app bundle for the
Intel CPU to TuxPaint-x86_64.app, and the bundle for the Apple Silicon to
TuxPaint-arm64.app, copy the app bundle from the Intel machine to the Apple
Silicon machine, then use the provided build-universal.sh script to combine the
two application bundles as below. The DMG file can be built afterwards:

    $ macos/build-universal.sh
    $ make TuxPaint.dmg

Android

March 29, 2023 Pere Pujal i Carabantes <perepujal@gmail.com> (Edited by Bill
Kendrick)

As of March 2023, the Android build of Tux Paint is maintained in a separate
code repository at GitHub: https://github.com/tux4kids/Tuxpaint-Android.
Detailed instructions are there; this acts as an overview.

Prerequisites

You will need recent versions of:

  * Gradle — build automation tool
  * Android Studio (Software Development Kit (SDK)) — to support Android app
    development (Java)
  * Android Native Development Kit (NDK) — to support native development in C/
    C++

To compile the latest Tux Paint, one has to sync the main SourceForge project's
tuxpaint Git repository with the GitHub project's TuxPaint-Android Git
repository. (Pere uses a shell script that backs up the app/src/main/jni/
tuxpaint directory in the Tuxpaint-Android GitHub repo and makes a build of
SourceForge's tuxpaint to generate translations and other things that are not
autogenerated in the Android builds, and then copies the SourceForge tuxpaint
back to Tuxpaint-Android.) (FIXME: It should be checked-in somewhere. For now,
see https://sourceforge.net/p/tuxpaint/feature-requests/224/)

For it to run you need the tuxpaint and Tuxpaint-Android sources one next to
one another, and the script in the directory containing both.

Fill the app/src/main/assets directory by running cd app/src/main/jni/tuxpaint
&& ./mkzip_assets.sh

Building

The Gradle build generates some variants: PlayStore, debugPlayStore,
offPlayStore and debugoffPlayStore. You must sign the non-debug ones to be able
to install them. (FIXME: Link to info on how to sign.) (Note: "playStore" ones
are intended to be uploaded to Google Play; this is currently managed by
Terrence Sheflin —March 2023. "offPlayStore" is the flavor that we distribute
as APK files on the Tux Paint website and SourceForge file hosting, and is the
variant built by the F-Droid app. repository.)

To trigger a build from F-droid, it suffices to tag a commit and push it to
GitHub. That doesn't guarantee the build will succeed though, so Pere usually
runs a local F-droid server to test the build and eventually adapt the
F-droid's build receipt before pushing the tag to GitHub.

The builds Pere distributes are all made with that local F-droid server. It has
the advantage of packing the sources and logs, and signing the APK. Most
importantly, it uses the same tools F-Droid will use to build Tux Paint, so you
can detect problems beforehand.

The receipt Pere uses for F-Droid builds is in the metadata dir of https://
gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata. The F-Droid server code is at https://gitlab.com/
fdroid/fdroidserver. To generate the server you will need 1GB free on disk. Run
the makebuildserver tool they provide, then, from the root of fdroiddata, run
../fdroidserver/fdroid build --server org.tuxpaint:NNNN (NNNN = version, e.g.
9288)

Prerequisites

Install the required develop packages in Terminal:

32-bit:
    pkgman install xcairo_x86_devel fribidi_x86_devel gdk_pixbuf_x86_devel
    libiconv_x86_devel libimagequant_x86_devel gettext_x86_libintl
    libpaper_x86_devel pango_x86_devel libpng16_x86_devel librsvg_x86_devel
    libsdl2_x86_devel sdl2_image_x86_devel sdl2_gfx_x86_devel
    sdl2_mixer_x86_devel sdl2_pango_x86_devel sdl2_ttf_x86_devel zlib_x86_devel

64-bit:
    pkgman install xcairo_devel fribidi_devel gdk_pixbuf_devel libiconv_devel
    libimagequant_devel gettext_libintl libpaper_devel pango_devel
    libpng16_devel librsvg_devel libsdl2_devel sdl2_image_devel sdl2_gfx_devel
    sdl2_mixer_devel sdl2_pango_devel sdl2_ttf_devel zlib_devel


For 32-bit you need to switch to the new compiler (currently gcc 11.2.0) with
setarch x86

Building

make PREFIX=/boot/home/config/non-packaged

Tux Paint Stamps

make install-all DATA_PREFIX=/boot/home/config/non-packaged/share/tuxpaint/

Debugging

⚙ Debugging output — to "STDOUT" on Linux and Unix, to a "stdout.txt" file on
Windows, and to the file "/tmp/tuxpaint.log" on macOS — can be enabled by
setting "DEBUG" (and, if verbose logging is wanted, "VERBOSE") #defines in "src
/debug.h" and (re)compiling Tux Paint.

Uninstalling Tux Paint

Windows

Using the Uninstaller

If you installed the Start Menu shortcuts (the default), then go to the
TuxPaint folder and select "Uninstall". A box will be displayed that will
confirm that you are about to uninstall Tux Paint and, if you are certain that
you want to permanently remove Tux Paint, click on the 'Uninstall' button.

When it has finished, click on the close button.

Using the Control Panel

It is also possible to use the entry "TuxPaint (remove only)" in the Control
Panel Add/Remove programs section.

macOS

Delete "TuxPaint.app" from the "Applications" folder. Data files, including the
configuration files, stamps, and saved pictures, may be found in "/Library/
Application Support/TuxPaint" (all users) and "/Users/USERNAME/Library/
Application Support/TuxPaint" (individual users).

Linux

Within the Tux Paint source directory (where you compiled Tux Paint), you can
use the "make uninstall" target to uninstall Tux Paint. By default, this must
be done by the "root" user ('superuser'), but if you installed Tux Paint
somewhere else (e.g., using a "PREFIX=..." setting to "make" and "make
install"), you may not, and will want to provide those same settings here. (See
the installation instructions above for further information.)
