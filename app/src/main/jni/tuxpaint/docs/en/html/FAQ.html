    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Fonts I added to Tux&nbsp;Paint only show squares</em>
        <p>
          The TrueType Font you're using might have the wrong
          encoding. If it's 'custom' encoded, for example, you can
          try running it through FontForge (<a href=
          "http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/">http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/</a>)
          to convert it to an ISO-8859 format. (Email us if you
          need help with special fonts.)
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>The Rubber Stamp tool is greyed out!</em>
        <p>
          This means that Tux&nbsp;Paint either couldn't find any
          stamp images, or was asked not to load them.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you installed Tux&nbsp;Paint, but did not install the
          separate, optional "Stamps" collection, quit
          Tux&nbsp;Paint and install it now. It should be available
          from the same place you got the main Tux&nbsp;Paint
          program. <i>(Note: As of version 0.9.14, Tux&nbsp;Paint
          comes with a small collection of example stamps.)</i>
        </p>

        <p>
          If you don't want to install the default collection of
          stamps, you can just create your own. See the <a href=
          "EXTENDING.html">EXTENDING TUX PAINT documentation</a>
          for more on creating PNG and SVG image files, TXT text
          description files, Ogg&nbsp;Vorbis, MP3 or WAV sound
          files, and DAT text data files that make up stamps.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, if you installed stamps, and think they should
          be loading, check to see that the "nostamps" option isn't
          being set. (Either via a "<code>--nostamps</code>" option
          to Tux&nbsp;Paint's command line, or
          "<code>nostamps=yes</code>" in the configuration file.)
        </p>

        <p>
          If so, either change/remove the "nostamps" option, or you
          can override it with "<code>--stamps</code>" on the
          command line or "<code>nostamps=no</code>" or
          "<code>stamps=yes</code>" in a configuration file.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>The Magic "Fill" Tool Looks Bad</em>
        <p>
          Tux&nbsp;Paint is probably comparing exact pixel colors
          when filling. This is faster, but looks worse. Run the
          command "<code>tuxpaint&nbsp;--version</code>" from a
          command line, and you should see, amongst the other
          output: "Low Quality Flood Fill enabled".
        </p>

        <p>
          To change this, you must rebuild Tux&nbsp;Paint from
          source. Be sure to remove or comment out any line that
          says:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <code>#define LOW_QUALITY_FLOOD_FILL</code>
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          in the "tuxpaint.c" file in the "src" directory.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>Stamp outlines are always rectangles</em>
        <p>
          Tux&nbsp;Paint was built with low-quality (but faster)
          stamp outlines.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rebuild Tux&nbsp;Paint from source. Be sure to remove or
          comment out any line that says:
        </p>

        <blockquote>

      <li>
        <em>Stamp thumbnails in the Stamp Selector look bad</em>
        <p>
          Tux&nbsp;Paint was probably compiled with the faster,
          lower quality thumbnail code enabled. Run the command:
          "<code>tuxpaint&nbsp;--version</code>" from a command
          line. If, amongst the other output, you see the text:
          "Low Quality Thumbnails enabled", then this is what's
          happening.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rebuild Tux&nbsp;Paint from source. Be sure to remove or
          comment out any line that says:

      </li>

      <li>
        <em>Pictures in the 'Open' dialog look bad</em>
        <p>
          "Low Quality Thumbnails" is probably enabled. See: "Stamp
          thumbnails in the Stamp Selector look bad", above.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>The color picker buttons are ugly squares, not pretty
        buttons!</em>
        <p>
          Tux&nbsp;Paint was probably compiled with the nice
          looking color selector buttons disabled. Run the command:
          "<code>tuxpaint&nbsp;--version</code>" from a command
          line. If, amongst the other output, you see the text:
          "Low Quality Color Selector enabled", then this is what's
          happening.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rebuild Tux&nbsp;Paint from source. Be sure to remove or
          comment out any line that says:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <code>#define LOW_QUALITY_COLOR_SELECTOR</code>
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          in the "tuxpaint.c" file in the "src" directory.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>All of the text is in uppercase!</em>
        <p>
          The "uppercase" option is on.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're running Tux&nbsp;Paint from a command-line,
          make sure you're not giving it an
          "<code>--uppercase</code>" option.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're running Tux&nbsp;Paint by double-clicking an
          icon, check the properties of the icon to see if
          "<code>--uppercase</code>" is listed as a command-line
          argument.
        </p>

        <p>
          If "<code>--uppercase</code>" isn't being sent on the
          command line, check Tux&nbsp;Paint's configuration file
          ("~/.tuxpaintrc" under Linux and Unix, "tuxpaint.cfg"
          under Windows) for a line reading:
          "<code>uppercase=yes</code>".
        </p>

        <p>
          Either remove that line, or simply run Tux&nbsp;Paint
          with the command-line argument:
          "<code>--mixedcase</code>", which will override the
          uppercase setting.
        </p>

        <p>
          Or use Tux&nbsp;Paint&nbsp;Config. and make sure "Show
          Uppercase Text Only" (under "Languages") is not checked.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>Tux&nbsp;Paint is in a different language!</em>
        <p>
          Make sure your locale setting is correct. See
          "Tux&nbsp;Paint won't switch to my language", below.
        </p>
      </li>

            <p>
              Make sure the locale you want is available. Check
              your "/etc/locale.gen" file. See the <a href=
              "OPTIONS.html">OPTIONS documentation</a> for the
              locales Tux&nbsp;Paint uses (especially when using
              the "<code>--lang</code>" option).

            <p>
              Note: Debian users can simply run
              "<code>dpkg-reconfigure locales</code>" if the
              locales are managed by "dpkg."

                <p>
                  Some translations require their own font. Chinese
                  and Korean, for example, need Chinese and Korean
                  TrueType Fonts installed and placed in the proper
                  location, respectively.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The appropriate fonts for such locales can be
                  downloaded from the Tux&nbsp;Paint website:

      Printing
    </h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Tux&nbsp;Paint won't print, gives an error, or prints
        garbage (Unix/Linux)</em>
        <p>
          Tux&nbsp;Paint prints by creating a PostScript rendition
          of the picture and sending it to an external command. By
          default, this command is the "lpr" printing tool.
        </p>

        <p>
          If that program is not available (for example, you're
          using CUPS, the Common Unix Printing System, and do not
          have "cups-lpr" installed), you will need to specify an
          appropriate command using the "printcommand" option in
          Tux&nbsp;Paint's configuration file. (See the <a href=
          "OPTIONS.html">OPTIONS documentation</a>.)
        </p>

        <p>
          <i>Note:</i> Versions of Tux&nbsp;Paint prior to 0.9.15
          used a different default command for printing,
          "pngtopnm&nbsp;|&nbsp;pnmtops&nbsp;|&nbsp;lpr", as
          Tux&nbsp;Paint output PNG format, rather than PostScript.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you had changed your "printcommand" option prior to
          Tux&nbsp;Paint 0.9.15, you will need to go back and alter
          it to accept PostScript.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>I get the message "You can't print yet!" when I go to
        print!</em>
        <p>
          The "print delay" option is on. You can only print once
          every <i>X</i>&nbsp;seconds.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're running Tux&nbsp;Paint from a command-line,
          make sure you're not giving it a
          "<code>--printdelay=...</code>" option.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're running Tux&nbsp;Paint by double-clicking an
          icon, check the properties of the icon to see if
          "<code>--printdelay=...</code>" is listed as a
          command-line argument.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a "<code>--printdelay=...</code>" option isn't being
          sent on the command line, check Tux&nbsp;Paint's
          configuration file ("~/.tuxpaintrc" under Linux and Unix,
          "tuxpaint.cfg" under Windows) for a line reading:
          "<code>printdelay=...</code>".
        </p>

        <p>
          Either remove that line, set the delay value to 0 (no
          delay), or decrease the delay to a value you prefer. (See
          the <a href="OPTIONS.html">OPTIONS documentation</a>).
        </p>

        <p>
          Or, you can simply run Tux&nbsp;Paint with the
          command-line argument: "<code>--printdelay=0</code>",
          which will override the configuration file's setting, and
          allow unlimited printing. (You won't have to wait between
          prints.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Or use Tux&nbsp;Paint&nbsp;Config. and make sure "Print
          Delay" (under "Printing") is set to "0&nbsp;seconds."
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>I simply can't print! The button is greyed out!</em>
        <p>
          The "no print" option is on.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're running Tux&nbsp;Paint from a command-line,
          make sure you're not giving it a "<code>--noprint</code>"
          option.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're running Tux&nbsp;Paint by double-clicking an
          icon, check the properties of the icon to see if
          "<code>--noprint</code>" is listed as an argument.
        </p>

        <p>
          If "<code>--noprint</code>" isn't on the command-line,
          check Tux&nbsp;Paint's configuration file
          ("~/.tuxpaintrc" under Linux and Unix, "tuxpaint.cfg"
          under Windows) for a line reading:
          "<code>noprint=yes</code>".
        </p>

        <p>
          Either remove that line, or simply run Tux&nbsp;Paint
          with the command-line argument: "<code>--print</code>",
          which will override the configuration file's setting.
        </p>

        <p>
          Or use Tux&nbsp;Paint&nbsp;Config. and make sure "Allow

        <em>There's no sound!</em>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>First, check the obvious:</em>
            <ul>
              <li>Are your speakers connected and turned on?
              </li>

              <li>Is the volume turned up on your speakers?
              </li>

              <li>Is the volume turned up in your Operating
              System's "mixer?"
              </li>

              <li>Are you certain you're using a computer with a
              sound card?
              </li>

              <li>Are any other programs running that use sound?
              (They may be 'blocking' Tux&nbsp;Paint from accessing
              your sound device)
              </li>

              <li>(Unix/Linux) Are you using a sound system, such
              as aRts, ESD or GStreamer? If so, try setting the
              "SDL_AUDIODRIVER" environment variable before running
              Tux&nbsp;Paint (e.g.,
              "<code>export&nbsp;SDL_AUDIODRIVER=arts</code>"). Or,
              run Tux&nbsp;Paint through the system's rerouter
              (e.g., run "<code>artsdsp&nbsp;tuxpaint</code>" or
              "<code>esddsp&nbsp;tuxpaint</code>", instead of
              simply "<code>tuxpaint</code>").
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <em>Is sound disabled in Tux Paint?</em>
            <p>
              If sound seems to work otherwise (and you're sure no
              other program is "blocking" the sound device), then
              Tux&nbsp;Paint may be running with a "no&nbsp;sound"
              option.
            </p>

            <p>
              Make sure you're not running Tux&nbsp;Paint with the
              "<code>--nosound</code>" option as a command-line
              argument. (See the <a href="OPTIONS.html">OPTIONS</a>
              documentation for details.)
            </p>

            <p>
              If it's not, then check the configuration file
              ("/etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.conf" and "~/.tuxpaintrc"
              under Linux and Unix, and "tuxpaint.cfg" under
              Windows) for a line reading:
              "<code>nosound=yes</code>".
            </p>

            <p>
              Either remove that line, or simply run Tux&nbsp;Paint
              with the command-line argument:
              "<code>--sound</code>", which will override the
              configuration file's setting.
            </p>

            <p>
              Alternatively, you can use
              Tux&nbsp;Paint&nbsp;Config. to change the
              configuration file. Make sure "Enable Sound Effects"
              (under "Video &amp; Sound") is checked, then click
              "Apply".
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <em>Were sounds temporarily disabled?</em>
            <p>
              Even if sounds are enabled in Tux&nbsp;Paint, it is
              possible to disable and re-enable them temporarily
              using the <b>[Alt]</b>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<b>[S]</b> key
              sequence. Try pressing those keys to see if sounds
              begin working again.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <em>Was Tux Paint built without sound support?</em>
            <p>
              Tux Paint may have been compiled with sound support
              disabled. To test whether sound support was enabled
              when Tux&nbsp;Paint was compiled, run Tux&nbsp;Paint
              from a command line, like so:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <code>tuxpaint --version</code>
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              If, amongst the other information, you see "Sound
              disabled", then the version of Tux&nbsp;Paint you're
              running has sound disabled. Recompile Tux&nbsp;Paint,
              and be sure NOT to build the "nosound" target. (i.e.,
              don't run "<code>make&nbsp;nosound</code>") Be sure
              the SDL_mixer library and its development headers are
              available!

        <em>Tux Paint makes too much noise! Can I turn them
        off?</em>
        <p>
          Yes, there are a number of ways to disable sounds in Tux
          Paint:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Press <b>[Alt]</b>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<b>[S]</b> while in
          Tux&nbsp;Paint to temporarily disable sounds. (Press that
          key sequence again to re-enable sounds.)
          </li>

          <li>Run Tux&nbsp;Paint with the "no&nbsp;sound" option:
            <ul>
              <li>Use Tux&nbsp;Paint&nbsp;Config to uncheck the
              "Enable Sound Effects" option (under "Video &amp;
              Sound").
              </li>

              <li>Edit Tux&nbsp;Paint's configuration file (see
              <a href="OPTIONS.html">OPTIONS</a> for details) and
              add a line containing "<code>nosound=yes</code>".
              </li>

              <li>Run "<code>tuxpaint&nbsp;--nosound</code>" from
              the command line or shortcut or desktop icon.
              </li>

              <li>Recompile Tux&nbsp;Paint with sound support
              disabled. (See above and <a href=
              "../INSTALL.txt">INSTALL.txt</a>.)
              </li>
            </ul>

      </li>

      <li>
        <em>The sound effects sound strange</em>
        <p>
          This could have to do with how SDL and SDL_mixer were
          initialized. (The buffer size chosen.)

        the window turns black!</em>
        <p>
          This is apparently a bug in the SDL library. Sorry.

        <em>When I run Tux&nbsp;Paint full-screen, it has large

        <p>
          Linux users - Your X-Window server is probably not set
          with the ability to switch to the desired resolution:
          800×600. (or whatever resolution you have Tux&nbsp;Paint
          set to run at.) (This is typically done manually under
          the X-Window server by pressing [Ctrl]-[Alt]-[KeyPad
          Plus] and -[KeyPad Minus].)
        </p>

        <p>
          For this to work, your monitor must support that
          resolution, and you need to have it listed in your X
          server configuration.
        </p>

        <p>
          Check the "Display" subsection of the "Screen" section of
          your XFree86 or X.org configuration file (typically
          "/etc/X11/XF86Config-4" or "/etc/X11/XF86Config",
          depending on the version of XFree86 you're using; 3.x or
          4.x, respectively, or "/etc/X11/xorg.conf" for X.org).
        </p>

        <p>
          Add "800x600" (or whatever resolution(s) you want) to the
          appropriate "Modes" line. (e.g., in the "Display"
          subsection that contains 24-bit color depth
          ("Depth&nbsp;24"), which is what Tux&nbsp;Paint tries to
          use.) e.g.:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <code>Modes "1280x1024" "1024x768" "800x600"

        <p>
          Note that some Linux distributions have tools that can

        <p>
          If Tux&nbsp;Paint aborts with the message: "You're
          already running a copy of Tux&nbsp;Paint!", this means it
          has been launched in the last 30 seconds. (On Unix/Linux,
          this message would appear in a terminal console if you
          ran Tux&nbsp;Paint from a command-line. On Windows, this
          message would appear in a file named
          "<code>stdout.txt</code>" in the same folder where
          <code>TuxPaint.exe</code> resides (e.g., in

        <p>
          A lockfile ("~/.tuxpaint/lockfile.dat" on Linux and Unix,

          Tux&nbsp;Paint isn't run too many times at once (e.g.,
          due to a child impatiently clicking its icon more than
          once).
        </p>

        <p>
          Even if the lockfile exists, it contains the 'time'
          Tux&nbsp;Paint was last run. If it's been more than 30
          seconds, Tux&nbsp;Paint should run fine, and simply
          update the lockfile with the current time.

        <p>
          If multiple users are sharing the directory where this

          extremely verbose (like listing the name of every
          rubber-stamp image it finds while loading them), then it
          was probably compiled with debugging output turned on.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rebuild Tux&nbsp;Paint from source. Be sure to remove or
          comment out any line that says:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <code>#define DEBUG</code>
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          in the "tuxpaint.c" file in the "src" directory.

      </li>

      <li>
        <em>Tux&nbsp;Paint is using options I didn't specify!</em>
        <p>
          By default, Tux&nbsp;Paint first looks at configuration
          files for options.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Unix and Linux</i>
            <p>
              Under Unix and Linux, it first examines the
              system-wide configuration file, located here:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <code>/etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.conf</code>
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              It then examines the user's personal configuration
              file:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <code>~/.tuxpaintrc</code>
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              Finally, any options sent as command-line arguments
              are used.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <i>Windows</i>
            <p>
              Under Windows, Tux&nbsp;Paint first examines the
              configuration file:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <code>tuxpaint.cfg</code>
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              Then, any options sent as command-line arguments are
              used.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This means that if anything is set in a configuration
          file that you don't want set, you'll need to either
          change the config. file (if you can), or override the
          option on the command-line.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, if "/etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.conf" includes an
          option to disable sound:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <code>nosound=yes</code>
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          You can reenable sound by either adding this option to
          your own ".tuxpainrc" file:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <code>sound=yes</code>
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Or by using this command-line argument:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <code>--sound</code>
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Linux and Unix users can also disable the system-wide
          configuration file by including the following
          command-line argument:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <code>--nosysconfig</code>
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Tux&nbsp;Paint will then only look at "~/.tuxpaintrc" and
          command-line arguments to determine what options should
          be set.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
