        What Is 'Tux&nbsp;Paint?'
      </h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Tux Paint is a free drawing program designed for young
          children (kids ages 3 and up). It has a simple,
          easy-to-use interface, fun sound effects, and an
          encouraging cartoon mascot who helps guide children as
          they use the program. It provides a blank canvas and a
          variety of drawing tools to help your child be creative.

          <dd>
            Tux&nbsp;Paint is meant to be a simple drawing program
            for young children. It is not meant as a
            general-purpose drawing tool. It <i>is</i> meant to be
            fun and easy to use. Sound effects and a cartoon
            character help let the user know what's going on, and
            keeps them entertained. There are also extra-large
            cartoon-style mouse pointer shapes.
          </dd>

          <dt>
            <b>Extensibility</b>
          </dt>

          <dd>
            Tux&nbsp;Paint is extensible. Brushes and "rubber
            stamp" shapes can be dropped in and pulled out. For
            example, a teacher can drop in a collection of animal
            shapes and ask their students to draw an ecosystem.
            Each shape can have a sound which is played, and
            textual facts which are displayed, when the child
            selects the shape.
          </dd>

          <dt>
            <b>Portability</b>
          </dt>

          <dd>
            Tux&nbsp;Paint is portable among various computer
            platforms: Windows, Macintosh, Linux, etc. The
            interface looks the same among them all. Tux&nbsp;Paint
            runs suitably well on older systems (like a
            Pentium&nbsp;133), and can be built to run better on
            slow systems.
          </dd>

          <dt>
            <b>Simplicity</b>
          </dt>

          <dd>
            There is no direct access to the computer's underlying
            intricacies. The current image is kept when the program
            quits, and reappears when it is restarted. Saving
            images requires no need to create filenames or use the
            keyboard. Opening an image is done by selecting it from
            a collection of thumbnails. Access to other files on
            the computer is restricted.

            If you installed Tux&nbsp;Paint on your computer using
            the 'Tux&nbsp;Paint&nbsp;Installer,' it will have asked
            you whether you wanted a 'Start' menu short-cut, and/or
            a desktop shortcut. If you agreed, you can simply run
            Tux&nbsp;Paint from the 'Tux&nbsp;Paint' section of
            your 'Start' menu (e.g., under "All&nbsp;Programs" on
            Windows&nbsp;XP), or by double-clicking the
            "Tux&nbsp;Paint" icon on your desktop.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you installed Tux&nbsp;Paint using the 'ZIP-file'
            download, or if you used the
            'Tux&nbsp;Paint&nbsp;Installer,' but chose not to have
            shortcuts installed, you'll need to double-click the
            "<code>tuxpaint.exe</code>" icon in the
            'Tux&nbsp;Paint' folder on your computer.
          </p>

          <p>
            By default, the 'Tux&nbsp;Paint&nbsp;Installer' will
            put Tux&nbsp;Paint's folder in
            "<code>C:\Program&nbsp;Files\</code>", though you may
            have changed this when the installer ran.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you used the 'ZIP-file' download, Tux&nbsp;Paint's
            folder will be wherever you put it when you unzipped
            the ZIP file.

                The Paint&nbsp;Brush tool lets you draw freehand,
                using various brushes (chosen in the Selector on
                the right) and colors (chosen in the Color palette
                towards the bottom).
              </p>

              <p>
                If you hold the mouse button down, and move the
                mouse, it will draw as you move.

              <p>
                As you draw, a sound is played. The bigger the
                brush, the lower the pitch.

                The Stamp tool is like a set of rubber stamps or
                stickers. It lets you paste pre-drawn or
                photographic images (like a picture of a horse, or
                a tree, or the moon) in your picture.
              </p>

              <p>
                As you move the mouse around the canvas, an outline
                follows the mouse, showing where the stamp will be
                placed, and how big it will be.

                There can be numerous categories of stamps (e.g.,
                animals, plants, outer space, vehicles, people,
                etc.). Use the Left and Right arrows to cycle
                through the collections.

              <p>
                Prior to 'stamping' an image onto your drawing,
                various effects can sometimes be applied (depending
                on the stamp):
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Some stamps can be colored or tinted. If the
                color palette below the canvas is activated, you
                can click the colors to change the tint or color of
                the stamp before placing it in the picture.
                </li>

                <li>Stamps can be shrunk and expanded, by clicking
                within the triangular-shaped series of bars at the
                bottom right; the larger the bar, the larger the
                stamp will appear in your picture.
                </li>

                <li>Many stamps may be flipped vertically, or
                displayed as a mirror-image, using the control
                buttons at the bottom right.

                  The shape will expand from where you initially
                  clicked, and will be centered around that position.
                  (This was Tux&nbsp;Paint's only behavior through

                  The shape will extend with one corner starting

                  default method of most other traditional drawing
                  software. (This option was added starting with

                In the canvas, click the mouse and hold it to

                shapes can change proportion (e.g., rectangle and
                oval may be wider than tall, or taller than wide),
                others cannot (e.g., square and circle).

                    Tux Paint allows inputting characters in
                    different languages. Most Latin characters
                    (<i>A</i>-<i>Z</i>, <i>ñ</i>, <i>è</i>, etc.)
                    can by entered directly. Some languages require
                    that Tux&nbsp;Paint be switched into an
                    alternate input mode before entering, and some
                    characters must be composed using numerous
                    keypresses.

                  <p>
                    When Tux Paint's locale is set to one of the
                    languages that provide alternate input modes, a
                    key is used to cycle through normal (Latin
                    character) and locale-specific mode or modes.

                    fonts do not include all characters for all
                    languages, so sometimes you'll need to change
                    fonts to see the characters you're trying to

                <p>
                  'Starters' can behave like a page from a coloring
                  book &mdash; a black-and-white outline of a picture,
                  which you can then color in, and the black outline
                  remains intact &mdash; or like a 3D photograph,
                  where you draw in between a foreground and background
                  layer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  'Templates' are similar, but simply provide a
                  background drawing to work off of.  Unlike 'Starters',
                  there is no layer that remains in the foreground of
                  anything you draw in the picture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When using the 'Eraser' tool, the original image
                  from the 'Starter' or 'Template' will reappear.
                  The 'Flip' and 'Mirror' Magic tools affect the
                  orientation of the 'Starter' or 'Template', as well.
                <p>
                  When you load a 'Starter' or 'Template', draw on it,
                  and then click 'Save,' it creates a new picture file
                  &mdash; it doesn't overwrite the original, so you
                  can use it again later (by accessing it from the 'New'
                  dialoge)..

                If you HAVE saved the picture before, or this is a

                    <i>Tux&nbsp;Paint</i> prints by generating a
                    PostScript representation of the drawing and
                    sending it to an external program. By default,
                    the program is:
                  </p>

                  <blockquote>
                    <code>lpr</code>

                  <p>
                    This command can be changed by setting the
                    "printcommand" value in Tux&nbsp;Paint's
                    configuration file.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    If the <b>[Alt]</b> key on the keyboard is
                    being pushed while clicking the 'Print' button,
                    as long as you're not in fullscreen mode, an
                    alternative program is run. By default, the
                    program is KDE's graphical print dialog:
                  </p>

                  <blockquote>
                    <code>kprinter</code>
                  </blockquote>

                  <p>
                    This command can be changed by setting the
                    "altprintcommand" value in Tux&nbsp;Paint's

                    By default, Tux&nbsp;Paint simply prints to the
                    default printer with default settings when the
                    'Print' button is pushed.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    However, if you hold the <b>[Alt]</b> (or
                    <b>[Option]</b>) key on the keyboard while
                    pushing the button, as long as you're not in
                    fullscreen mode, your operating system's
                    printer dialog will appear, where you can
                    change the settings.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    You can have the printer configuration changes
                    stored by using the "printcfg" option, either
                    by using "<code>--printcfg</code>" on the
                    command-line, or "<code>printcfg=yes</code>" in
                    Tux&nbsp;Paint's own configuration file
                    ("<code>tuxpaint.cfg</code>").

                  <p>
                    If the "printcfg" option is used, printer
                    settings will be loaded from the file
                    "<code>print.cfg</code>" in your personal
                    folder (see below). Any changes will be saved
                    there as well.

                    By default, Tux&nbsp;Paint only shows the
                    printer dialog (or, on Linux/Unix, runs the
                    "altprintcommand", e.g., "kprinter" instead of
                    "lpr") if the <b>[Alt]</b> (or <b>[Option]</b>)
                    key is held while clicking the 'Print' button.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    However, this behavior can be changed. You can
                    have the printer dialog always appear by using
                    "<code>--altprintalways</code>" on the
                    command-line, or "<code>altprint=always</code>"
                    in Tux&nbsp;Paint's configuration file. Or, you
                    can prevent the <b>[Alt]</b>/<b>[Option]</b>
                    key from having any effect by using
                    "<code>--altprintnever</code>", or
                    "<code>altprint=never</code>".

          Tux&nbsp;Paint</a>
    </h1>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Since Tux&nbsp;Paint's 'Open' dialog only displays pictures
        you created with Tux&nbsp;Paint, what if you want to load
        some other picture or photograph into Tux&nbsp;Paint to
        edit?
      </p>

      <p>
        To do so, you simply need to convert the picture into a PNG
        (Portable Network Graphic) image file, and place it in
        Tux&nbsp;Paint's "saved" directory:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>
          Windows Vista
        </dt>

        <dd>
          Inside the user's "<code>AppData</code>" folder, e.g.:
          <code>"C:\Users\<i>(user&nbsp;name)</i>\AppData\Roaming\TuxPaint\saved\</code>"
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Windows 95, 98, ME, 2000, XP
        </dt>

        <dd>
          Inside the user's "<code>Application&nbsp;Data</code>"
          folder, e.g.: <code>"C:\Documents and
          Settings\<i>(user&nbsp;name)</i>\Application
          Data\TuxPaint\saved\</code>"
        </dd>

        <dt>
          macOS
        </dt>

        <dd>
          Inside the user's "<code>Library</code>" folder:
          <code>"/Users/<i>(user&nbsp;name)</i>/Library/Application
          Support/Tux&nbsp;Paint/saved/</code>"
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Linux/Unix
        </dt>

        <dd>
          Inside a hidden "<code>.tuxpaint</code>" directory, in
          the user's home directory:
          "<code>$(HOME)/.tuxpaint/saved/</code>"
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> It is from this folder that you can copy or
        open pictures drawn in Tux&nbsp;Paint using other
        applications.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Using '<code>tuxpaint-import</code>'
      </h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Linux and Unix users can use the
          "<code><b>tuxpaint-import</b></code>" shell script which
          gets installed when you install Tux&nbsp;Paint. It uses
          some NetPBM tools to convert the image
          ("<code>anytopnm</code>"), resize it so that it will fit
          in Tux&nbsp;Paint's canvas ("<code>pnmscale</code>"), and
          convert it to a PNG ("<code>pnmtopng</code>").
        </p>

        <p>
          It also uses the "<code>date</code>" command to get the
          current time and date, which is the file-naming
          convention Tux&nbsp;Paint uses for saved files.
          (Remember, you are never asked for a 'filename' when you
          go to Save or Open pictures!)
        </p>

        <p>
          To use '<code>tuxpaint-import</code>', simply run the
          command from a command-line prompt and provide it the
          name(s) of the file(s) you wish to convert.
        </p>

        <p>
          They will be converted and placed in your Tux&nbsp;Paint
          'saved' directory. (Note: If you're doing this for a
          different user - e.g., your child, you'll need to make
          sure to run the command under their account.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Example:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <code>$ <b>tuxpaint-import grandma.jpg</b><br>
          grandma.jpg -&gt;
          /home/username/.tuxpaint/saved/20020921123456.png<br>
          jpegtopnm: WRITING A PPM FILE</code>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The first line
          ("<code>tuxpaint-import&nbsp;grandma.jpg</code>") is the
          command to run. The following two lines are output from
          the program while it's working.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now you can load Tux&nbsp;Paint, and a version of that
          original picture will be available under the 'Open'
          dialog. Just double-click its icon!
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>
        Doing it Manually
      </h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Windows, macOS, BeOS, and Haiku users must currently do
          the conversion manually.
        </p>

        <p>
          Load a graphics program that is capable of both loading
          your picture and saving a PNG format file. (See the
          documentation file "<a href="../PNG.txt">PNG.txt</a>" for
          a list of suggested software, and other references.)
        </p>

        <p>
          When Tux Paint loads an image that's not the same size as
          its drawing canvas, it scales (and sometimes smears the
          edges of) the image so that it fits within the canvas.
        </p>

        <p>
          To avoid having the image stretched or smeared, you can
          resize it to Tux&nbsp;Paint's canvas size. This size
          depends on the size of the Tux&nbsp;Paint window, or
          resolution at which Tux&nbsp;Paint is run, if in
          fullscreen. (<b>Note:</b> The default resolution is
          800x600.) See "Calculating Image Dimensions", below.
        </p>

        <p>
          Save the picture in PNG format. It is <b>highly</b>
          recommended that you name the filename using the current
          date and time, since that's the convention Tux&nbsp;Paint
          uses:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <code><b>YYYYMMDDhhmmss</b>.png</code>
        </blockquote>

        <ul>
          <li>YYYY = Year
          </li>

          <li>MM = Month (01-12)
          </li>

          <li>DD = Day (01-31)
          </li>

          <li>HH = Hour, in 24-hour format (00-23)
          </li>

          <li>mm = Minute (00-59)
          </li>

          <li>ss = Second (00-59)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          e.g.:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <code>20020921130500</code> - for September 21, 2002,
          1:05:00pm
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Place this PNG file in your Tux&nbsp;Paint
          '<code>saved</code>' directory. (See above.)
        </p>

        <h3>
          Calculating Image Dimensions
        </h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The width of Tux&nbsp;Paint's canvas is simply the
            width of the window (e.g., 640, 800 or 1024 pixels),
            minus 192.
          </p>

          <p>
            Calculating the height of Tux&nbsp;Paint's canvas
            requires multiple steps:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Take the height of the window (e.g, 480, 600 or 768
            pixels) and subtract 144
            </li>

            <li>Take the result of Step&nbsp;1 and divide it by 48
            </li>

            <li>Take the result of Step&nbsp;2 and round it down
            (e.g., 9.5 becomes simply 9)
            </li>

            <li>Take the result of Step&nbsp;3 and multiply it by
            48
            </li>

            <li>Finally, take the result of Step&nbsp;4 and add 40
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            <b>Example:</b> Tux&nbsp;Paint running at fullscreen on
            a 1440x900 display.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>The canvas width is simply 1440&nbsp;-&nbsp;192, or
            1248.
            </li>

            <li>The canvas height is calculated as:
              <ol>
                <li>900&nbsp;-&nbsp;144, or 756
                </li>

                <li>756&nbsp;/&nbsp;48, or 15.75
                </li>

                <li>15.75 rounded down, or 15
                </li>

                <li>15&nbsp;*&nbsp;48, or 720
                </li>

                <li>720&nbsp;+&nbsp;40, or 760
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            So the canvas within a 1440x900 Tux&nbsp;Paint window
            is 1248x760.
