<p>If you wish to add or change things like Brushes and Rubber Stamps
used by Tux&nbsp;Paint, you can do it fairly easily by simply putting
or removing files on your hard disk.</p>

<p>Note: You'll need to restart Tux&nbsp;Paint for the changes to take
effect.</p>

<h2>Where Files Go</h2>
<blockquote>
  <h3>Standard Files</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Tux&nbsp;Paint looks for its various data files in its
    'data' directory.</p>

    <h4>Linux and Unix</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Where this directory goes depends on what value was set for
      "<code>DATA_PREFIX</code>" when Tux&nbsp;Paint was built.  See
      INSTALL.txt for details.</p>

      <p>By default, though, the directory is:</p>

      <blockquote><code>
        /usr/local/share/tuxpaint/
      </code></blockquote>
      
      <p>If you installed from a package, it is more likely to be:</p>

      <blockquote><code>
        /usr/share/tuxpaint/
      </code></blockquote>
      
    </blockquote>


    <h4>Windows</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Tux&nbsp;Paint looks for a directory called 'data' in the same
      directory as the executable.  This is the directory that the
      installer used when installing Tux&nbsp;Paint e.g.:</p>

      <blockquote><code>
        C:\Program&nbsp;Files\TuxPaint\data
      </code></blockquote>
      
    </blockquote>


    <h4>Mac OS X</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Tux&nbsp;Paint stores its data files inside the "Tux&nbsp;Paint"
      application (which is actually a special kind of folder on
      Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X).  The following steps explain how to get to
      the folders within:</p>

      <ol>
      <li>Bring up a 'context' menu by holding the [Control] key and clicking
        the Tux&nbsp;Paint icon the in Finder.  (If you have a mouse with more
        than one button, you can simply right-click the icon.)</li>
      <li>Select "Show&nbsp;Contents" from the menu that appears.
        A new Finder window will appear with a folder inside called
        "Contents."</li>
      <li>Open the "Contents" folder and open the "Resources" folder found
        inside.</li>
      <li>There, you will find the "starters", "stamps" and "brushes"
        folders.  Adding new content to these folders will make the content
        available to any user that launches this copy (icon) of
        Tux&nbsp;Paint.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><em>Note:</em> If you install a newer version of Tux&nbsp;Paint
      and replace or discard the old version, you will lose changes made 
      by following the instructions above, so keep backups of your new 
      content (stamps, brushes, etc.).</p>
      
      <p>Tux&nbsp;Paint also looks for files in a "TuxPaint" folder
      that you can place in your system's "Application&nbsp;Support" folder
      (found under "Library" at the root of your hard disk):</p>

      <blockquote><code>
        /Library/Application&nbsp;Support/TuxPaint/
      </code></blockquote>

      <p>It also looks for files in the user's "Application Support" folder:
      </p>

      <blockquote><code>
        /Users/<i>(user&nbsp;name)</i>/Library/Application Support/TuxPaint/
      </code></blockquote>
      
      <p>When you upgrade to a newer version of Tux Paint, the contents of this
      TuxPaint folder will stay the same and remain accessible by all users
      of Tux Paint.</p>

    </blockquote>
    
  </blockquote>

  <hr size=1 noshade>
  

  <h3>Personal Files</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>You can also create brushes, stamps, fonts and 'starters' in your
    own directory (folder) for Tux&nbsp;Paint to find.</p>
    

    <h4>Windows</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Your personal Tux&nbsp;Paint folder is stored in your
      "Application Data".  For example, on newer Windows (set up
      for an English-speaking user):</p>
      
      <blockquote><code>
        C:\Documents and Settings\<i>(user&nbsp;name)</i>\Application
        Data\TuxPaint\
      </code></blockquote>
      
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Mac OS X</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Your personal Tux&nbsp;Paint folder is stored in your
      "Application Support" folder:
  
      <blockquote><code>
        /Users/<i>(user&nbsp;name)</i>/Library/Application Support/
        TuxPaint/</code>
      </code></blockquote>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Linux and Unix</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Your personal Tux&nbsp;Paint directory is
      "<code>$(HOME)/.tuxpaint/</code>" (also known as
      "<code>~/.tuxpaint/</code>".</p>
      
      <p>That is, if your home directory is "<code>/home/karl</code>", then
      your Tux&nbsp;Paint directory is
      "<code>/home/karl/.tuxpaint/</code>".</p>
      
      <p>Don't forget the period ("<code>.</code>") before the
      '<code>tuxpaint</code>'!</p>
    </blockquote>
  
    <p>To add brushes, stamps fonts, and 'starters,' create subdirectories
    under your personal Tux&nbsp;Paint directory named
    "<code><b>brushes</b></code>", "<code><b>stamps</b></code>",
    "<code><b>fonts</b></code>" and
    "<code><b>starters</b></code>" respectively.</p>

    <p>(For example, if you created a brush named "<code>flower.png</code>",
    you would put it in "<code>~/.tuxpaint/brushes/</code>" under Linux or
    Unix.)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<hr size=1 noshade>


<h2>Brushes</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>The brushes used for drawing with the 'Brush' and 'Lines' tools in
  Tux&nbsp;Paint are simply PNG image files.</p>

  <img src="../../html/images/brush_edit.png" width=123 height=147 alt="" align=right>

  <p>The alpha (transparency) of the PNG image is used to determine the shape
  of the brush, which means that the shape can be 'anti-aliased' and even
  partially-transparent!</p>

  <p>Greyscale pixels in the brush PNG will be drawn using the
  currently-selected color in Tux&nbsp;Paint.  Color pixels will be
  tinted.</p>

  <p>Brush images should be no wider than 40&nbsp;pixels across and
  no taller than 40&nbsp;pixels high.  (i.e., the maximum size
  can be 40&nbsp;x&nbsp;40.)</p>


  <h3>Brush Options</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Aside from a graphical shape, brushes can also be given other
    attributes.  To do this, you need to create a 'data&nbsp;file'
    for the brush.</p>
    
    <p>A brush data file is simply a text file containing the options.</p>

    <p>The file has the same name as the PNG image, but a "<code>.dat</code>"
    extension.  (e.g., "<code>brush.png</code>"'s data file is the text
    file "<code>brush.dat</code>" in the same directory.)</p>

    <h4>Brush Spacing</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>As of Tux&nbsp;Paint version 0.9.16, you can now specify the spacing
      for brushes (that is, how often they are drawn).  By default, the
      spacing will be the brush's height, divided by 4.</p>
    
      <p>Add a line containing the line "<code><b>spacing=<i>N</i></b></code>"
      to the brush's data file, where <i>N</i> is the spacing you want
      for the brush.  (The lower the number, the more often the brush is
      drawn.)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Animated Brushes</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>As of Tux&nbsp;Paint version 0.9.16, you may now create animated
      brushes.  As the brush is used, each frame of the animation is
      drawn.</p>

      <p>Lay each frame out across a wide PNG image.  For example,
      if your brush is 30x30 and you have 5 frames, the image should
      be 150x30.</p>

      <p>Add a line containing the line "<code><b>frames=<i>N</i></b></code>"
      to the brush's data file, where <i>N</i> is the number of frames
      in the brush.</p>

      <p><b>Note:</b> If you'd rather the frames be flipped through
      randomly, rather than sequentially, also add a line containing
      "<code><b>random</b></code>" to the brush's data file.</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <h4>Directional Brushes</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>As of Tux&nbsp;Paint version 0.9.16, you may now create directional
      brushes.  As the brush is used, different shapes are drawn, depending
      on the direction the brush is going.</p>

      <p>The directional shapes are divided into a 3x3 square in a PNG image.
      For example, if your brush is 30x30, the image should be 90x90, and
      each of the direction's shapes placed in a 3x3 grid.  The center
      region is used for no motion.  The top right is used for motion that's
      both up, and to the right.  And so on.</p>

      <p>Add a line containing the line "<code><b>directional</b></code>"
      to the brush's data file.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Animated Directional Brushes</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>You may mix both animated and directional features into one
      brush.  Use both options ("<code><b>frames=<i>N</i></b></code>" and
      "<code><b>directional</b></code>"), in separate lines in the
      brush's "<code>".dat</code>" file.</p>

      <p>Lay the brush out so that each 3x3 set of directional shapes are
      laid out across a wide PNG image.  For example, if the brush is 30x30
      and there are 5 frames, it would be 450x90.  (The leftmost 150x90 pixels
      of the image represent the 9 direction shapes for the first frame,
      for example.)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Place the brush image PNGs (and any data text files) in the
  "<code><b>brushes</b></code>" directory.</p>

  <p>Note: If your new brushes all come out as solid squares or rectangles,
  it's because you forgot to use alpha transparency!  See the documentation
  file "PNG.txt" for more information and tips.</p>
  
  <br clear=all>

<h2>Stamps</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>All stamp-related files go in the "<code><b>stamps</b></code>" directory.
  It's useful to create subdirectories and sub-subdirectories
  there to organize the stamps.  (For example, you can have a
  "<code>holidays</code>" folder with "<code>halloween</code>" and
  "<code>christmas</code>" sub-folders.)</p>

  <h3>Images</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rubber Stamps in Tux&nbsp;Paint can be made up of a number of separate
    files.  The one file that is required is, of course, the picture
    itself.</p>

    <img src="../../html/images/stamp_edit.png" width=128 height=147 alt="" align=right>
 
    <p>As of Tux&nbsp;Paint version 0.9.17, Stamps may be either PNG
    bitmap images or SVG vector images.  They can be full-color or greyscale.
    The alpha (transparency) channel of PNGs is used to determine the actual
    shape of the picture (otherwise you'll stamp a large rectangle on your
    drawings).</p>

    <p>PNGs can be any size, and Tux&nbsp;Paint (by default) provides
    a set of sizing buttons to let the user scale the stamp up (larger)
    and down (smaller).</p>

    <p>SVGs are vector-based, and will be scaled appropriately for the
    canvas being used in Tux&nbsp;Paint.</p>

    <p>Note: If your new PNG stamps all have solid rectangular-shaped outlines
    of a solid color (e.g., white or black), it's because you forgot to use
    alpha transparency!  See the documentation file
    "<a href="../PNG.txt">PNG.txt</a>" for more information and tips.</p>

    <p>Note: If your new SVG stamps seem to have a lot of whitespace,
    make sure the SVG 'document' is no larger than the shape(s) within.
    If they are being clipped, make sure the 'document' is large enough
    to contain the shape(s).  See the documentation file
    "<a href="../SVG.txt">SVG.txt</a>" for more information and tips.</p>

    <p><b>Advanced Users:</b> The
    <a href="ADVANCED-STAMPS-HOWTO.html">Advanced Stamps HOWTO</a> describes,
    in detail, how to make PNG images which will scale perfectly when used as
    stamps in Tux&nbsp;Paint.</p>

    <br clear=all>
  </blockquote>

  <hr size=1 noshade>

  <h3>Description Text</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Text (".TXT") files with the same name as the PNG or SVG.
    (e.g., "<code>picture.png</code>"'s description is stored in
    "<code>picture.txt</code>" in the same directory.)</p>
    
    <p>The first line of the text file will be used as the US English
    description of the stamp's image. It must be encoded in UTF-8.</p>

    <h4>Language Support</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Additional lines can be added to the text file to provide
      translations of the description, to be displayed when Tux&nbsp;Paint
      is running in a different locale (like French or Spanish).</p>

      <p>The beginning of the line should correspond to the language code
      of the language	in question (e.g., "<code>fr</code>" for French, and
      "<code>zh_TW</code>" for Traditional Chinese), followed by
      "<code>.utf8=</code>" and the translated description (encoded
      in UTF-8).</p>
      
      <p>There are scripts in the "<code>po</code>" directory for converting
      the text files to PO format (and back) for easy translation to
      different languages. Therefore you should never add or change translations
      in the .txt files directly.</p>

      <p>If no translation is available for the language Tux&nbsp;Paint
      is currently running in, the US English text is used.</p>
   </blockquote>

    <h4>Windows Users</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Use NotePad or WordPad to edit/create these files.
      Be sure to save them as Plain Text, and make sure they have
      "<code>.txt</code>" at the end of the filename...</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>

  <hr size=1 noshade>

  <h3>Sound Effects</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>WAVE (".wav") or OGG Vorbis (".ogg")
    files with the same name as the PNG or SVG.
    (e.g., "<code>picture.svg</code>"'s sound effect is the sound file
    "<code>picture.wav</code>" in the same directory.)</p>
    
    <h4>Language Support</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>For sounds for different locales (e.g., if the sound is someone
      saying a word, and you want translated versions of the word said),
      also create WAV or OGG files with the locale's label in the filename, in
      the form: "<code><b>STAMP_LOCALE.EXT</b></code>"</p>

      <p>"<code>picture.png</code>"'s sound effect, when Tux&nbsp;Paint is run
      in Spanish mode, would be "<code>picture_es.wav</code>".
      In French mode, "<code>picture_fr.wav</code>".  In Brazilian
      Portuguese mode, "<code>picture_pt_BR.wav</code>". And so on...</p>

      <p>If no localized sound effect can be loaded, Tux&nbsp;Paint will
      attempt to load the 'default' sound file.
      (e.g., "<code>picture.wav</code>")</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Note: For descriptive sounds (not sound effects, like a bang or
    a bird chirping), consider using the Descriptive&nbsp;Sounds,
    described below.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <hr size=1 noshade>

  <h3>Descriptive Sound</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>WAVE (".wav") or OGG Vorbis (".ogg")
    files with the same name as the PNG or SVG, followed by
    "<code>_desc</code>" (e.g., "<code>picture.svg</code>"'s descriptive
    sound is the sound file "<code>picture_desc.ogg</code>" in the same
    directory.)</p>
    
    <h4>Language Support</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>For descriptions in different languages,
      also create WAV or OGG files with both "<code>_desc</code>" and
      the locale's label in the filename, in
      the form: "<code><b>STAMP_desc_LOCALE.EXT</b></code>"</p>
      
      <p>"<code>picture.png</code>"'s descriptive sound, when Tux&nbsp;Paint
      is run in Spanish mode, would be "<code>picture_desc_es.wav</code>".
      In French mode, "<code>picture_desc_fr.wav</code>".  In
      Brazilian Portuguese mode, "<code>picture_desc_br_PT.wav</code>".
      And so on...</p>

      <p>If no localized descriptive sound can be loaded, Tux&nbsp;Paint will
      attempt to load the 'default' descriptive sound file.
      (e.g., "<code>picture_desc.wav</code>")</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>

  <hr size=1 noshade>

  <h3>Stamp Options</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Aside from a graphical shape, a textual description, and a sound
    effect, stamps can also be given other attributes.  To do this, you need
    to create a 'data&nbsp;file' for the stamp.</p>
    
    <p>A stamp data file is simply a text file containing the options.</p>
    
    <p>The file has the same name as the PNG or SVG image, but a
    "<code>.dat</code>" extension.  (e.g., "<code>picture.png</code>"'s
    data file is the text file "<code>picture.dat</code>" in the same
    directory.)</p>

    <h4>Colored Stamps</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Stamps can be made to be either "colorable" or "tintable."</p>
    
      <h5>Colorable</h5>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Colorable" stamps they work much like brushes - you pick the stamp
        to get the shape, and then pick the color you want it to be.
        (Symbol stamps, like the mathematical and musical ones, are an
        example.)</p>

        <p>Nothing about the original image is used except the transparency
        (from "alpha" channel).  The color of the stamp comes out solid.</p>

        <center><img src="../../html/images/ex_colorable.png" width=74 height=92
        alt=""></center>
      
        <p>Add a line containing the word "<code><b>colorable</b></code>"
	to the stamp's data file.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h5>Tinted</h5>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Tinted" stamps are similar to "colorable" ones, except the
        details of the original image are kept.  (To put it technically,
        the original image is used, but its hue is changed, based on the
        currently-selected color.)</p>

        <center><img src="../../html/images/ex_tintable.png" width=151 height=78
        alt=""></center>

        <p>Add a line containing the word "<code><b>tintable</b></code>"
	to the stamp's data file.</p>

        <h6>Tinting Options:</h6>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>Depending on the contents of your stamp, you might want to
	  have Tux&nbsp;Paint use one of a number of methods when tinting it.
	  Add one of the following lines to the stamp's data file:</p>

	  <dl>
	  <dt>"<code><b>tinter=normal</b></code>" (default)</dt>
	  <dd>This is the normal tinting mode. (Hue range is
            +/-&nbsp;18&nbsp;degrees, 27 replace.)</dd>

	  <dt>"<code><b>tinter=anyhue</b></code>"</dt>
	  <dd>This remaps all hues in the stamp. (Hue range is
            +/-&nbsp;180&nbsp;degrees.)</dd>

	  <dt>"<code><b>tinter=narrow</b></code>"</dt>
	  <dd>This like 'anyhue', but a narrower hue angle.
            (Hue range is +/-&nbsp;6&nbsp;degrees, 9 replace.)</dd>

	  <dt>"<code><b>tinter=vector</b></code>"</dt>
	  <dd>This is map 'black through white' to
            'black through destination'.</dd>
	  </dl>

        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Unalterable Stamps</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>By default, a stamp can be flipped upside down, shown as a mirror
      image, or both.  This is done using the control buttons below the
      stamp selector, at the lower right side of the screen in
      Tux&nbsp;Paint.</p>

      <p>Sometimes, it doesn't make sense for a stamp to be flippable or
      mirrored; for example, stamps of letters or numbers.
      Sometimes stamps are symmetrical, so letting the user flip or mirror
      them isn't useful.</p>

      <p>To make a stamp un-flippable, add the option
      "<code><b>noflip</b></code>" to the stamp's data file.</p>

      <p>To keep a stamp from being mirrored, add a line containing the word
      "<code><b>nomirror</b></code>" to the stamp's data file.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Initial Stamp Size</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>By default, Tux&nbsp;Paint assumes that your stamp is sized
      appropriately for unscaled display on a 608x472 canvas. This is
      the original Tux&nbsp;Paint canvas size, provided by a 640x480 screen.
      Tux&nbsp;Paint will then adjust the stamp according to the current
      canvas size and, if enabled, the user's stamp size controls.</p>

      <p>If your stamp would be too big or too small, you can specify
      a scale factor. If your stamp would be 2.5 times as wide (or tall)
      as it should be, add the option "<code><b>scale 40%</b></code>" or
      "<code><b>scale 5/2</b></code>" or "<code><b>scale 2.5</b></code>"
      or "<code><b>scale 2:5</b></code>" to your image. You may include
      an "<code><b>=</b></code>" if you wish, as in
      "<code><b>scale=40%</b></code>".</p>
    </blockquote>


    <h4>Windows Users</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>You can use NotePad or WordPad to create these file.
      Be sure to save it as Plain Text, and make sure the filename
      has "<code>.dat</code>" at the end, and not "<code>.txt</code>"...</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Pre-Mirrored and Flipped Images</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In some cases, you may wish to provide a pre-drawn version of
    a stamp's mirror-image, flipped image, or even both.  For example,
    imagine a picture of a fire&nbsp;truck with the words
    "<i>Fire&nbsp;Department</i>" written across the side.  You probably
    do not want that text to appear backwards when the image is flipped!</p>

    <p>To create a mirrored version of a stamp that you want Tux&nbsp;Paint
    to use, rather than mirroring one on its own, simply create a second
    "<code>.png</code>" or "<code>.svg</code>" graphics file with the
    same name, except with "<code><b>_mirror</b></code>" before the filename
    extension.</p>
    
    <p>For example, for the stamp "<code><b>truck.png</b></code>" you would
    create another file named "<code><b>truck_mirror.png</b></code>", which
    will be used when the stamp is mirrored (rather than using a
    backwards version of '<code>truck.png</code>').</p>

    <p>As of Tux&nbsp;Paint 0.9.18, you may similarly provide a pre-flipped
    image with "<code><b>_flip</b></code>" in the name, and/or an image that
    is both mirrored and flipped, by naming it
    "<code><b>_mirror_flip</b></code>".</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> If the user flips and mirrors an image, and a pre-drawn
    "<code>_mirror_flip</code>" doesn't exist, but either "<code>_flip</code>"
    or "<code>_mirror</code>" does, it will be used, and mirrored or flipped,
    respectively.</p>

<h2>'Starters'</h2>
<blockquote>
  <img src="../../html/images/open_open.png" width=48 height=48 alt="" align=right>

  <p>'Starter' images appear in the 'New' dialog, along with solid
  color background choices. (Note: In earlier versions of Tux&nbsp;Paint,
  they appeared in the 'Open' dialog, together with saved drawings.)</p>
  
  <p>Unlike pictures drawn in Tux&nbsp;Paint by users and then opened
  later, opening a 'starter' creates a new drawing.  When you save, the
  'starter' image is not overwritten.  Additionally, as you edit your new
  picture, the contents of the original 'starter' affect it.</p>

  <b>Coloring-Book Style</b>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>The most basic kind of 'starter' is similar to a picture in a coloring
    book.  It's an outline of a shape which you can then color in and
    add details to.  In Tux&nbsp;Paint, as you draw, type text, or stamp
    stamps, the outline remains 'above' what you draw.  You can erase the
    parts of the drawing you made, but you can't erase the outline.</p>

    <p>To create this kind of 'starter' image, simply draw an outlined
    picture in a paint program, make the rest of the graphic transparent
    (that will come out as white in Tux&nbsp;Paint), and save it as a
    PNG format file.</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> Previous to Tux Paint 0.9.21, images needed to be
    black and transparent.  As of 0.9.21, if a Starter is black and white,
    with no transparency, white will be converted to transparent when the
    Starter is opened.</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> Previous to Tux Paint 0.9.22, Starters had to be in
    PNG or JPEG (backgrounds only) format.  As of 0.9.22, they may be in
    SVG (vector graphics) or KPX (templates from Kid Pix, another childrens'
    drawing program; they are special files which simply contain a JPEG
    within).</p>
  </blockquote>

  <b>Scene-Style</b>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Along with the 'coloring-book' style overlay, you can also provide
    a separate background image as part of a 'starter' picture.  The
    overlay acts the same: it can't be drawn over, erased, or affected by
    'Magic' tools.  However, the background can be!</p>

    <p>When the 'Eraser' tool is used on a picture based on this kind of
    'starter' image, rather than turning the canvas to a solid color,
    such as white, it returns that part of the canvas to the original
    background picture from the 'starter'.</p>

    <p>By creating both an overlay and a background, you can create a
    'starter' which simulates depth.  Imagine a background that shows
    the ocean, and an overlay that's a picture of a reef.  You can then
    draw (or stamp) fish in the picture.  They'll appear in the ocean,
    but never 'in front of' the reef.</p>

    <p>To create this kind of 'starter' picture, simply create an overlay
    (with transparency) as described above, and save it as a PNG.
    Then create another image (without transparency), and save it with
    the same filename, but with "<code>-back</code>" appended to the
    name.  (e.g., "<code>reef-back.png</code>" would be the background
    ocean picture that corresponds to the "<code>reef.png</code>"
    overlay, or foreground.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>The 'starter' images should be the same size as Tux&nbsp;Paint's
  canvas.  (See the "Loading Other Pictures into Tux&nbsp;Paint" section of
  <a href="README.html">README</a> for details on sizing.)  If they are not,
  they will be stretched, without affecting the shape ("aspect ratio");
  however some smudging may be applied to the edges.</p>
  
  <p>Place them in the "<code><b>starters</b></code>" directory.
  When the 'New' dialog is accessed in Tux&nbsp;Paint, the 'starter'
  images will appear in the screen that appears, after the various solid color
  choices.</p>
  
  <p><b>Note:</b> 'Starters' can't be saved over from within Tux&nbsp;Paint,
  since loading a 'starter' is really like creating a new image.
  (Instead of being blank, though there's already something there to work
  with.)  The 'Save' command simply creates a new picture, like it would
  if the 'New' command had been used.</p>

  <p><b>Note:</b> 'Starters' are 'attached' to saved pictures, via a
  small text file that has the same name as the saved file, but with
  "<code>.dat</code>" as the extension.  This allows the overlay and
  background, if any, to continue to affect the drawing even after
  Tux&nbsp;Paint has been quit, or another picture loaded or started.
  (In other words, if you base a drawing on a 'starter' image, it will
  always be affected by it.)</p>

<h2>'Templates'</h2>
<blockquote>
  <img src="../../html/images/open_open.png" width=48 height=48 alt="" align=right>

  <p>'Template' images also appear in the 'New' dialog, along with solid
  color background choices and 'Starters'. (Note: Tux Paint prior to
  version 0.9.22 did not have the 'Template' feature.)</p>
  
  <p>Unlike pictures drawn in Tux&nbsp;Paint by users and then opened
  later, opening a 'template' creates a new drawing.  When you save, the
  'template' image is not overwritten.  Unlike 'starters', there is no
  immutable 'layer' above the canvas. You may draw over any part of it.</p>

  <p>When the 'Eraser' tool is used on a picture based on a 'template',
  rather than turning the canvas to a solid color, such as white, it
  returns that part of the canvas to the original picture from the
  'template'.</p>

  <p>'Templates' are simply image files (in PNG, JPG, SVG or KPX format).
  No preparation or conversion should be required.</p>
  
  <p>The 'template' images should be the same size as Tux&nbsp;Paint's
  canvas.  (See the "Loading Other Pictures into Tux&nbsp;Paint" section of
  <a href="README.html">README</a> for details on sizing.)  If they are not,
  they will be stretched, without affecting the shape ("aspect ratio");
  however some smudging may be applied to the edges.</p>
  
  <p>Place them in the "<code><b>templates</b></code>" directory.
  When the 'New' dialog is accessed in Tux&nbsp;Paint, the 'template'
  images will appear in the screen that appears, after the various solid color
  choices and 'starters'.</p>
  
  <p><b>Note:</b> 'Templates' can't be saved over from within Tux&nbsp;Paint,
  since loading a 'template' is really like creating a new image.
  (Instead of being blank, though there's already something there to work
  with.)  The 'Save' command simply creates a new picture, like it would

  <p><b>Note:</b> 'Templates' are 'attached' to saved pictures, via a
  small text file that has the same name as the saved file, but with
  "<code>.dat</code>" as the extension.  This allows the background
  to continue to be available to the drawing (e.g., when using the 'Eraser'
  tool) even after Tux&nbsp;Paint has been quit, or another picture loaded
  or started.  (In other words, if you base a drawing on a 'template' image,
  it will always be affected by it.)</p>

<h2>Translations</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Tux Paint supports numerous languages, thanks to use of the
  "gettext" localization library.  (See <a href="OPTIONS.html">OPTIONS</a>
  for how to change locales in Tux&nbsp;Paint.)</p>

  <p>To translate Tux&nbsp;Paint to a new language, copy the translation
  template file, "<code>tuxpaint.pot</code>" (found in Tux&nbsp;Paint's
  source code, in the folder "<code>src/po/</code>").  Rename the copy as a
  "<code>.po</code>" file, with an appropriate name for the locale you're
  translating to (e.g., "<code>es.po</code>" for Spanish; or
  "<code>pt_BR.po</code>" for Brazilian&nbsp;Portuguese, versus
  "<code>pt.po</code>" or "<code>pt_PT.po</code>" for Portuguese spoken in
  Portugal.)</p>

  <p>Open the newly-created "<code>.po</code>" file &mdash; you can edit
  in a <i>plain</i> text edtior, such as Emacs, Pico or VI on Linux, or
  NotePad on Windows.  The original English text used in Tux&nbsp;Paint
  is listed in lines starting with "<code>msgid</code>".  Enter your
  translations of each of these pieces of text in the empty
  "<code>msgstr</code>" lines directly below the corresponding
  "<code>msgid</code>" lines.  (<i>Note:</i> Do not remove the quotes.)</p>

  <p>Example:</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><code>msgid "Smudge"<br>
  msgstr "<u>Manchar</u>"<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  msgid "Click and drag to draw large bricks."<br>
  msgstr "<u>Haz clic y arrastra para dibujar ladrillos grandes.</u>"
  </code></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>A graphical tool, called <i><b>poEdit</b></i>
  (<a href="http://www.poedit.net/">http://www.poedit.net/</a>), is available
  for Linux, Windows and Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X.</p>

  <p><i>Note:</i> It is best to always work off of the <i>latest</i>
  Tux&nbsp;Paint text catalog template ("<code>tuxpaint.pot</code>"),
  since new text is added, and old text is occasionally changed.
  The text catalog for the upcoming, unreleased version of Tux&nbsp;Paint
  can be found in Tux&nbsp;Paint's CVS repository
  (see: <a href="http://www.tuxpaint.org/download/source/cvs/">http://www.tuxpaint.org/download/source/cvs/</a>),
  and on the Tux&nbsp;Paint website at
  <a href="http://www.tuxpaint.org/help/po/">http://www.tuxpaint.org/help/po/</a>.</p>

  <p>To edit an existing translation, download the latest "<code>.po</code>"
  file for that language, and edit it as described above.</p>

  <p>You may send new or edited translation files to Bill&nbsp;Kendrick,
  lead developer of Tux&nbsp;Paint, at:
  <a href="mailto:bill@newbreedsoftware.com">bill@newbreedsoftware.com</a>,
  or post them to the "tuxpaint-i18n" mailing list
  (see: <a href="http://www.tuxpaint.org/lists/">http://www.tuxpaint.org/lists/</a>).</p>
  
  <p>Alternatively, if you have an account with
  <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge.net</a>, you can request
  to be added to the "<code>tuxpaint</code>" project and receive write-access
  to the CVS source code repository so that you may commit your changes
  directly.</p>

  <p><i>Note:</i> Additional locale support also requires additions
  to Tux&nbsp;Paint's source code (<code>/src/i18n.h</code> and
  <code>/src/i18n.c</code>), and requires updates to the <code>Makefile</code>,
  to have the "<code>.po</code>" gettext catalog source files compiled into
  "<code>.mo</code>" files, and installed, for use at runtime.</p>

<h2>Alternative Input Methods</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>As of version 0.9.17, Tux&nbsp;Paint's "Text" tool can provide
  alternative input methods for some languages.  For example, when
  Tux&nbsp;Paint is running with a Japanese locale, the
  <b>right&nbsp;[Alt]</b> key can be pressed to cycle between Latin,
  Romanized Hiragana and Romanized Katakana modes.
  This allows native characters and words to be entered into the "Text" tool by
  typing one or more keys on a keyboard with Latin characters (e.g., a
  US&nbsp;QWERTY keyboard).</p>

  <p>To create an input method for a new locale, create a text file
  with a name based on the locale (e.g., "<code>ja</code>" for Japanese),
  with "<code>.im</code>" as the extension (e.g., "<code>ja.im</code>").</p>

  <p>The "<code>.im</code>" file can have multiple character mapping sections
  for different character mapping modes.  For example, on a Japanese typing
  system, typing <b>[K]</b>&nbsp;<b>[A]</b> in Hiragana mode generates a
  different Unicode character than typing
  <b>[K]</b>&nbsp;<b>[A]</b> in Katakana mode.</p>

  <p>List the character mappings in this file, one per line.  Each line should
  contain (separated by whitespace):</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>the Unicode value of the character, in hexadecimal
    (more than one character can be listed, separated by a colon (':'),
    this allowing some sequences to map to words)
  <li>the keycode sequence (the ASCII characters that must be entered to
    generate the Unicode character)
  <li>a flag (or "<code>-</code>")
  </ul>

  <p>Start additional character mapping sections with a line containign the word
  "<code>section</code>".</p>

  <p>Example:</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><code># Hiragana<br>
  304B &nbsp; ka &nbsp; -<br>
  304C &nbsp; ga &nbsp; -<br>
  304D &nbsp; ki &nbsp; -<br>
  304E &nbsp; gi &nbsp; -<br>
  304D:3083 &nbsp; kya &nbsp; -<br>
  3063:305F &nbsp; tta &nbsp; -<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  # Katakana<br>
  section<br>
  30AB &nbsp; ka &nbsp; -<br>
  30AC &nbsp; ga &nbsp; -<br>
  30AD &nbsp; ki &nbsp; -<br>
  30AE &nbsp; gi &nbsp; -
  </code></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><i>Note:</i> Blank lines within the "<code>.im</code>" file
  will be ignored, as will any text following a "<code>#</code>"
  (pound/hash) character &mdash; it can be used to denote comments,
  as seen in the example above.</p>

  <p><i>Note:</i> Meanings of the flags are locale-specific, and are processed
  by the language-specific source code in "<code>src/im.c</code>".
  For example, "<code>b</code>" is used in Korean to handle
  Batchim, which may carry over to the next character.</p>

  <p><i>Note:</i> Additional input method support also requires additions
  to Tux&nbsp;Paint's source code (<code>/src/im.c</code>), and requires
  updates to the <code>Makefile</code>,
  to have the "<code>.im</code>" files installed, for use at runtime.</p>
