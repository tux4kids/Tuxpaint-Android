      <p>
        A graphical tool is available that allows you to change Tux Paint's behavior. However, if you'd rather not install and use this tool, or want a better understanding of the available options, please continue reading.      </p>

    <h1>
      Configuration File    </h1>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        You can create a simple configuration file for Tux Paint, which it will read each time you start it up.      </p>

      <p>
        The file is simply a plain text file containing the options you want enabled:      </p>

      <h2>
        Linux and Unix Users      </h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The file you should create is called "<code><b>.tuxpaintrc</b></code>" and it should be placed in your home directory. (a.k.a. "<code>~/.tuxpaintrc</code>" or "<code>$HOME/.tuxpaintrc</code>")        </p>

        <h3>
          System-Wide Configuration File        </h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Before this file is read, a system-wide configuration file is read. (By default, this configuration has no settings enabled.) It is located at:          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <code>/etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.conf</code>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            You can disable reading of this file altogether, leaving the settings as defaults (which can then be overridden by your "<code>.tuxpaintrc</code>" file and/or command-line arguments) by using the command-line option:          </p>

    <h1>
      Available Options    </h1>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The following settings can be set in the configuration file. (Command-line settings will override these. See the "<a href="#command_line"><i>Command-Line Options</i></a>" section, below.)      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>
          <code><b>fullscreen=yes</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            Run the program in full screen mode, rather than in a window.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
            <code><b>fullscreen=native</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            Run the program in full screen mode. Additionally, assume the screen's current resolution (set by the operating system).          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>windowsize=<i>SIZE</i></b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            Run the program at a different size (in windowed mode) or at a different screen resolution (in fullscreen mode), rather than the default (usually 800x600).          </p>

          <p>
            The <i>SIZE</i> value should be presented in pixels, in 'width-by-height' format, with an "x" (lowercase X) between the values. The size can be anything that's at least 640 wide, and at least 480 tall.          </p>

          <p>
            Some examples:          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>640x480
            </li>

            <li>1024x768
            </li>

            <li>768x1024
            </li>

            <li>1600x1200
            </li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>orient=portrait</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            Swaps the width/height options given to Tux Paint, useful for rotating the window on portait displays, such as a tablet PC that's in tablet orientation.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>native=yes</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            When running Tux Paint in fullscreen mode, this assumes the screen's current resolution (overriding any "<code>windowsize</code>" option), as set by the operating system.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>buttonsize=<i>SIZE</i></b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            Set the pixel size of buttons in Tux Paint's user interface (overriding the default of "48"). Useful when using very high-density displays or coarse input devices, such as eye gaze trackers.          </p>

          <p>
            The <i>SIZE</i> value should be presented in pixels, and can be anything between 24 and 192, inclusive. Most buttons are square, and this will affect their width and height.          </p>

          <p>
            Note: If the chosen button size would cause the buttons to be too large for all required UI elements to appear under Tux Paint's chosen window size, the largest possible button size will be used. (A note will appear in <code>stderr</code>.)          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>allowscreensaver=yes</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            By default, Tux Paint prevents your system's screensaver from starting up. You can override this by using the "<code>allowscreensaver</code>" option. Note: This requires version 1.2.12 or higher of the SDL library. (You can also do this by setting the "<code>SDL_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER</code>" environment variable on your system to "<code>1</code>".)          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>nosound=yes</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            Disable sound effects. (Note: Pressing <b>[Alt]</b> + <b>[S]</b> cannot be used to reenable sounds if they were disabled using this option.)          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>nostereo=yes</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            Disable stereo panning support. (Useful for users with hearing impairment in one ear, or places where a single speaker or headphone is being used.)          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>noquit=yes</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            Disable the on-screen "Quit" button and prevent the <b>[Escape]</b> key from quitting Tux Paint.          </p>

          <p>
            Using the <b>[Alt]</b> + <b>[F4]</b> keyboard combination or clicking the window's close button (assuming you're not in fullscreen mode) still works to quit Tux Paint.          </p>

          <p>
            You can also use the following keyboard combination to quit: <b>[Shift]</b> + <b>[Control]</b> + <b>[Escape]</b>.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>noprint=yes</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            Disable the printing feature.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
            <code><b>printdelay=<i>SECONDS</i></b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            Restrict printing so that printing can occur only once every <i>SECONDS</i> seconds.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>printcommand=<i>COMMAND</i></b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            <i>(Linux and Unix only)</i>
          </p>

          <p>
            Use the command <i>COMMAND</i> to print a PostScript format file when the 'Print' button is clicked. If this option is not specifically not set, the default command is:          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <code>lpr</code>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            <b>Note:</b> Versions of Tux Paint prior to 0.9.15 sent PNG format data to the print command (which defaulted to "<code>pngtopnm | pnmtops | lpr</code>").          </p>

          <p>
            If you set an alternative <code><b>printcommand</b></code> in the configuration file prior to version 0.9.15, you will need to change it.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>altprintcommand=<i>COMMAND</i></b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            <i>(Linux and Unix only)</i>
          </p>

          <p>
            Use the command <i>COMMAND</i> to print a PostScript format file when the 'Print' button is clicked while the <b>[Alt]</b> modifier key is being held. (This is typically used for providing a print dialog, similar to when pressing <b>[Alt]</b>+'Print' in Windows and macOS.)          </p>

          <p>
            If this option is not specifically not set, the default command is KDE's graphical print dialog:          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <code>kprinter</code>
          </blockquote>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>printcfg=yes</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            <i>(Windows and macOS only)</i>
          </p>

          <p>
            Tux Paint will use a printer configuration file when printing. Push the <b>[Alt]</b> key while clicking the 'Print' button in Tux Paint to cause a Windows print dialog window to appear.          </p>

          <p>
            (Note: This only works when not running Tux Paint in fullscreen mode.) Any configuration changes made in this dialog will be saved to the file "<code>userdata/print.cfg</code>" , and used again, as long as the "printcfg" option is set.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>altprint=always</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            This causes Tux Paint to always show the printer dialog (or, on Linux/Unix, run the "altprintcommand") when the 'Print' button is clicked. In other words, it's like clicking 'Print' while holding <b>[Alt]</b>, except you don't need to hold <b>[Alt]</b> every time.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>altprint=never</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            This prevents Tux Paint from <i>ever</i> showing the printer dialog (or, on Linux/Unix, run the "altprintcommand") when the 'Print' button is clicked. In other words, it makes the <b>[Alt]</b> key have no effect when clicking the 'Print' button.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>altprint=mod</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            This is the normal, default behavior. Tux Paint shows a printer dialog (or, on Linux/Unix, runs the "altprintcommand"), when the <b>[Alt]</b> key is pressed while the 'Print' button is clicked. Clicking 'Print' without holding <b>[Alt]</b> prints without showing a dialog.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>papersize=<i>PAPERSIZE</i></b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            <i>(Platforms that use Tux Paint's internal PostScript generator — not Windows, macOS, BeOS, or Haiku.)</i>
          </p>

          <p>
            Tell Tux Paint what size PostScript to generate. If none is specified, Tux Paint first checks your <code>$PAPER</code> environment variable, then the file <code>/etc/papersize</code>, then uses the the 'libpaper' library's default paper size.          </p>

          <p>
            Valid paper sizes include: letter, legal, tabloid, executive, note, statement, a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, b0, b1, b2 b3, b4, 10x14, 11x17, halfletter, halfexecutive, halfnote, folio, quarto, ledger, archA, archB, archC, archD, archE, flsa, flse, csheet, dsheet, esheet.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>nolockfile=yes</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            By default, Tux Paint uses what's known as a 'lockfile' to prevent it from being launched more than once in 30 seconds. (This is to avoid accidentally running multiple copies; for example, by double-clicking a single-click launcher, or simply impatiently clicking the icon multiple times.)          </p>

          <p>
            To make Tux Paint ignore the lockfile, allowing it to run again, even if it was just launched less than 30 seconds ago, enable this setting in the configuration file, or run Tux Paint with the <code>--nolockfile</code> option on the command-line.          </p>

          <p>
            By default, the lockfile is stored in "<code>~/.tuxpaint/</code>" under Linux and Unix, and "<code>userdata\</code>" under Windows.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>simpleshapes=yes</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            Disable the rotation step of the 'Shape' tool. Click, drag and release is all that will be needed to draw a shape.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>uppercase=yes</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            All text will be rendered only in uppercase (e.g., "Brush" will be "BRUSH"). Useful for children who can read, but who have only learned uppercase letters so far.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>grab=yes</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            Tux Paint will attempt to 'grab' the mouse and keyboard, so that the mouse is confined to Tux Paint's window, and nearly all keyboard input is passed directly to it.          </p>

          <p>
            This is useful to disable operating system actions that could get the user out of Tux Paint <b>[Alt]-[Tab]</b> window cycling, <b>[Ctrl]-[Escape]</b>, etc. This is especially useful in fullscreen mode.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>noshortcuts=yes</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            This disable keyboard shortcuts (e.g., <b>[Ctrl]-[S]</b> for save, <b>[Ctrl]-[N]</b> for a new image, etc.)          </p>

          <p>
            This is useful to prevent unwanted commands from being activated by children who aren't experienced with keyboards.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>nowheelmouse=yes</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            This disables support for the wheel on mice that have it. (Normally, the wheel will scroll the selector menu on the right.)          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>nobuttondistinction=yes</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            Prior to Tux Paint 0.9.15, the middle and right buttons on a mouse could also be used for clicking. In version 0.9.15, it was changed so that <i>only</i> the left mouse button worked, so as to not train children to use the wrong button.          </p>

          <p>
            However, for children who have trouble with the mouse, this distinction between the two or three buttons on a mouse can be disabled (returning Tux Paint to its old behavior) by using this option.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>nofancycursors=yes</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            This disables the fancy mouse pointer shapes in Tux Paint, and uses your environment's normal mouse pointer.          </p>

          <p>
            In some enviornments, the fancy cursors cause problems. Use this option to avoid them.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>hidecursor=yes</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            This completely hides the mouse pointer shapes in Tux Paint.          </p>

          <p>
            This is useful for touchscreen devices, such as tablet PCs.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>nooutlines=yes</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            In this mode, much simpler outlines and 'rubber-band' lines are displayed when using the <b>Lines</b>, <b>Shapes</b>, <b>Stamps</b> and <b>Eraser</b> tools.          </p>

          <p>
            This can help when Tux Paint is run on very slow computers, or displayed on a remote X-Window display.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>sysfonts=yes</b></code>

            Prior to version 0.9.21, Tux Paint loaded all fonts in its own fonts directory, including locale-specific ones (e.g., the one for Tibetan, which had no latin characters).

          <p>
            The directory itself (e.g., "<code>~/Pictures/TuxPaint</code>") will be created, if it doesn't exist.          </p>
          <p>
            If the <em>parent</em> directory (e.g., "<code>~/Pictures/TuxPaint</code>") also does not exist, Tux Paint will attempt to create it as well (but not any directories higher than that).          </p>

          <p>
            Tux Paint will search for subdirectories/subfolders named "<code>brushes</code>", "<code>stamps</code>", "<code>starters</code>", "<code>templates</code>", and "<code>fonts</code>" under the specified data directory.          </p>

            <li>Linux &amp; Unix — Under a hidden directory named "<code>.tuxpaint</code>" in your home directory (aka "<code>~</code>" or "<code>$HOME</code>")<br>
                Example: <code>/home/<i>username</i>/.tuxpaint/brushes/</code>            </li>

            <li>Windows — Inside a folder named "<code>TuxPaint</code>" in your "<code>Application Data</code>" folder.<br>
                Example: <code>C:\Documents and Settings\<i>Username</i>\Application Data\TuxPaint\brushes\</code>            </li>

            <li>macOS — Inside a folder named "<code>TuxPaint</code>" in your "<code>Application Support</code>" folder.<br>
                Example: <code>/Users/<i>Username</i>/Library/Application Support/TuxPaint/brushes/</code>            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <b>Note:</b> Prior to version 0.9.18, Tux Paint would use the same setting or default as for "<code>savedir</code>" to search for data files. As of version 0.9.18, they may be specified separately.          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Note:</b> When specifying a Windows drive (e.g., "<code>H:\</code>"), you must also specify a subdirectory.          </p>

          <p>
            This disables the "<i>Save over the old version...?</i>" prompt when saving an existing file. With this option, the older version will always be replaced by the new version, automatically.          </p>

          <p>
            This also disables the "<i>Save over the old version...?</i>" prompt when saving an existing file. This option, however, will always save a new file, rather than overwrite the older version.          </p>

          <p>
            <i>(This option is redundant, since this is the default.)</i>
          When saving an existing drawing, you will be first asked whether to save over the older version or not.          </p>

        <dd>
          <p>
            This disables Tux Paint's ability to save files (and therefore disables the on-screen "Save" button). It can be used in situations where the program is only being used for fun, or in a test environment.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>autosave=yes</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            This prevents Tux Paint from asking whether you want to save the current picture when quitting, and assumes you do.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>startblank=yes</b></code>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>
            This causes Tux Paint to display a blank canvas when it first starts up, rather than loading the last image that was being edited.          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <code><b>colorfile=<i>FILENAME</i></b></code>

        <dd>
          <p>
            You may override Tux Paint's default color palette by creating a plain ASCII text file that describes the colors you want, and pointing to that file using the "<code>colorfile</code>" option.          </p>

          <p>
            The file should list one color per line. Colors are defined in terms of their Red, Green and Blue values, each from 0 (off) to 255 (brightest). (For more information, try Wikipedia's "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rgb">RGB color model</a>" article.)          </p>

          <p>
            Colors may be listed using three decimal numbers (e.g., "<code>255 68 136</code>") or a 6- or 3-digit-long hexadecimal 'triplet' (e.g., "<code>#ff4488</code>" or "<code>#F48</code>").          </p>

          <p>
            After the color definition (on the same line) you may enter text to describe the color. Tux will display this text when the color is clicked. (For example, "<code>#FFF White as snow.</code>")          </p>

          <p>
            As an example, you can see the default colors currently used in Tux Paint in: "<a href="../../default_colors.txt"><code>default_colors.txt</code></a>".          </p>

          <p>
            NOTES: You must separate decimal values with spaces, and begin hexadecimal values with a pound/number-sign character ("<code>#</code>"). In 3-digit hexadecimal, each digit is used for both the high and low halves of the byte, so "<code>#FFF</code>" is the same as "<code>#FFFFFF</code>", not "<code>#F0F0F0</code>".          </p>
        </dd>

            How many rows of color palette buttons to show; useful when using a large color palette (see "<code>colorfile</code>", above), and/or for use with coarse input devices (like eyegaze trackers).  "<code>ROWS</code>" may be between "1" (the default) and "3".          </p>

      <p>
        If any of the above options are set in "<code>/etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.config</code>", you can override them in your own "<code>~/.tuxpaintrc</code>" file.      </p>

      <p>
        For true/false options, like "<code>noprint</code>" and "<code>grab</code>", you can simply say they equal 'no' in your "<code>~/.tuxpaintrc</code>" file:      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <code>noprint=no<br>
        uppercase=no</code>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Or, you can use options similar to the command-line override options described below. For example:      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <code>print=yes<br>

      <p>
        Tux Paint has been translated into a number of languages. To access the translations, you can use the "<code>--lang</code>" option on the command-line to set the language (e.g. "<code>--lang spanish</code>") or use the "<code>lang=</code>" setting in the configuration file (e.g., "<code>lang=spanish</code>").      </p>

      <p>
        Tux Paint also honors your environment's current locale. (You can override it on the command-line using the "<code>--locale</code>" option; see <a href="#locale">above</a>.)      </p>

      <p>
        Use the option "<code>--lang help</code>" to list the available language options available.      </p>

      <h2>
        Setting Your Environment's Locale      </h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Changing your locale will affect much of your environment.        </p>

        <p>
          As stated above, along with letting you choose the language at runtime using command-line options ("<code>--lang</code>" and "<code>--locale</code>"), Tux Paint honors the global locale setting in your environment.        </p>

        <p>
          If you haven't already set your environment's locale, the following will briefly explain how:        </p>

        <h3>
          Linux/Unix Users        </h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            First, be sure the locale you want to use is enabled by editing the file "<code>/etc/locale.gen</code>" on your system and then running the program "<code>locale-gen</code>" as root.          </p>

          <p>
            <i>Note: Debian users may be able to simply run the command "<code>dpkg-reconfigure locales</code>" as root to bring up a configuration dialog. Ubuntu users may be able to run "<code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure localeconf</code>" (the "localeconf" package may need to be installed first), or you may need to edit the file "<code>/var/lib/locales/supported.d/local</code>" first, and add locales they want, from the list found in "<code>/usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED</code>".</i>          </p>

          <p>
            Then, before running Tux Paint, set your "<code>$LANG</code>" environment variable to one of the locales listed above. (If you want all programs that can be translated to be, you may wish to place the following in your login script; e.g. "<code>~/.profile</code>", "<code>~/.bashrc</code>", "<code>~/.cshrc</code>", etc.)          </p>

          <p>
            For example, in a Bourne Shell (like BASH):          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <code>export LANG=es_ES ; \<br>
            tuxpaint</code>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            And in a C Shell (like TCSH):          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <code>setenv LANG es_ES ; \<br>
            tuxpaint</code>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>
          Windows Users        </h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Tux Paint will recognize the current locale and use the appropriate files by default. So this section is only for people trying different languages.          </p>

          <p>
            The simplest thing to do is to use the "<code>--lang</code>" switch in the shortcut (see "INSTALL"). However, by using an MSDOS Prompt window, it is also possible to issue a command like this:          </p>

          <blockquote>

            For something more permanent, you can set an 'environment variable' using the "System properties" dialogue as follows:          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Press the "<b>[Windows]+[R]</b>" key combination to open the "Run ..." dialogue.</li>
            <li>Enter "<code>sysdm.cpl</code>" in the text box and click the "<b>[OK]</b>" button to open the "System properties" dialogue.</li>
            <li>Select the "Advanced" tab.</li>
            <li>Click the "Environment Variables..." button.</li>
            <li>Edit the value of the parameter "<code>LANG</code>" (create it, if it doesn't exists).</li>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Some languages require special fonts be installed. These font files (which are in TrueType format (TTF)), are much too large to include with the Tux Paint download, and are available separately. (See the table above, under the "<a href="#different_language"><i>Choosing a Different Language</i></a>" section.)        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Note:</b> As of version 0.9.18, Tux Paint uses the "SDL_Pango" library, which utilizes the "Pango" library to render text in the user interface, rather than using "SDL_ttf" directly. Unless your copy of Tux Paint was built without Pango support, special fonts should <b><i>no longer be necessary</i></b>.        </p>

        <p>
          When running Tux Paint in a language that requires its own font, Tux Paint will try to load the font file from its system-wide "<code><b>fonts</b></code>" directory (under a "<code><b>locale</b></code>" subdirectory). The name of the file corresponds to the first two letters in the 'locale' code of the language (e.g., "ko" for Korean, "ja" for Japanese, "zh_tw" for Traditional Chinese).        </p>

        <p>
          For example, under Linux or Unix, when Tux Paint is run in Korean (e.g., with the option "<code>--lang korean</code>"), Tux Paint will attempt to load the following font file:        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <code>/usr/share/tuxpaint/fonts/locale/<b>ko.ttf</b></code>
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          You can download fonts for supported languages from Tux Paint's website, <a href="http://www.tuxpaint.org/">http://www.tuxpaint.org/</a>. (Look in the 'Fonts' section under 'Download.')        </p>

        <p>
          Under Unix and Linux, you can use the <code>Makefile</code> that comes with the font to install the font in the appropriate location.        </p>
