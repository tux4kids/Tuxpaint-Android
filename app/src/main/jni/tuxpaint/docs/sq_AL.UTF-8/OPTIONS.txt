Formësim i Tux Paint-it.

A graphical tool is available that allows you to change Tux Paint's behavior.
However, if you'd rather not install and use this tool, or want a better
understanding of the available options, please continue reading.

Kartelë Formësimi

You can create a simple configuration file for Tux Paint, which it will read
each time you start it up.

The file is simply a plain text file containing the options you want enabled:

Përdorues Linux-esh dhe Unix-esh

/home/emër përdoruesi/.tuxpaintrc

Kartelë Formësimi Për Mbarë Sistemin

Before this file is read, a system-wide configuration file is read. (By
default, this configuration has no settings enabled.) It is normally located
at:

    /etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.conf

Përdorues të MacOS-it

/Users/emër përdoruesi/Library/Application Support/TuxPaint/tuxpaint.cfg

at:

    /Library/Application Support/TuxPaint/tuxpaint.cfg

Përdorues Windows-i

C:\Users\emër përdoruesi\AppData\Roaming\TuxPaint\tuxpaint.cfg

You can use NotePad or WordPad to create this file. Be sure to save it as Plain
Text, and make sure the filename doesn't have ".txt" at the end...

Kartelë Formësimi Për Mbarë Sistemin

Before this file is read, a system-wide configuration file is read. (By
default, this configuration has no settings enabled.) It is normally located
at:

C:\Program Files\TuxPaint\tuxpaint.cfg

Haiku Users

/boot/home/config/settings/TuxPaint/tuxpaint.conf

⚙ You can disable reading of this file altogether, leaving the settings as
defaults (which can then be overridden by your personal config. file and/or
command-line arguments) by using the command-line option "--nosysconfig".

Mundësi të Gatshme

The following settings can be set in the configuration file. (Command-line
settings will override these. See the "Command-Line Options" section, below.)

Video/Tingull

Video

fullscreen=yes

    Run the program in full screen mode, rather than in a window.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "fullscreen=no". In both cases, may be
    overridden by the command-line option "--windowed".



fullscreen=native

    Run the program in full screen mode. Additionally, assume the screen's
    current resolution (set by the operating system).



windowsize=MADHËSI

    Run the program at a different size (in windowed mode) or at a different
    screen resolution (in fullscreen mode), rather than the default (usually
    800x600).

    The MADHËSI value should be presented in pixels, in 'width-by-height'
    format, with an "x" (lowercase X) between the values. The size can be
    anything that's at least 640 wide, and at least 480 tall.

    Disa shembuj:

      + 640x480
      + 1024x768
      + 768x1024
      + 1600x1200

    💡 If only one display is available, and Tux Paint is being run in windowed
    (not fullscreen) mode, and the chosen window size exceeds the capabilities
    of the display, Tux Paint will fall back to the display's dimensions.



orient=portrait

    Swaps the width/height options given to Tux Paint, useful for rotating the
    window on portait displays, such as a tablet PC that's in tablet
    orientation.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "orient=landscape". In both cases, may
    be overridden by the command-line option "--orient=landscape".



native=yes

    When running Tux Paint in fullscreen mode, this assumes the screen's
    current resolution (overriding any "windowsize" option), as set by the
    operating system.



allowscreensaver=yes

    By default, Tux Paint prevents your system's screensaver from starting up.
    You can override this by using the "allowscreensaver" option. (You can also
    do this by setting the "SDL_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER" environment variable
    on your system to "1".)

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "allowscreensaver=no" or
    "disablescreensaver=yes". In both cases, may be overridden by the
    command-line option "--disablescreensaver".




Tingull

nosound=yes

    Disable sound effects. (Note: Pressing [Alt] + [S] cannot be used to
    reenable sounds if they were disabled using this option.)

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "nosound=no" or "sound=yes". In both
    cases, may be overridden by the command-line option "--sound".



nostereo=yes

    Disable stereo panning support. (Useful for users with hearing impairment
    in one ear, or places where a single speaker or headphone is being used.)

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "nostereo=no" or "stereo=yes". In both
    cases, may be overridden by the command-line option "--stereo".




Madhësi Ndërfaqeje

buttonsize=MADHËSI

    Set the pixel size of buttons in Tux Paint's user interface (overriding the
    default of "48"). Useful when using very high-density displays or coarse
    input devices, such as eye gaze trackers.

    The MADHËSI value should be presented in pixels, and can be anything
    between 24 and 192, inclusive. Most buttons are square, and this will
    affect their width and height.

    A value of "auto" may be provided, and Tux Paint will choose a suitable
    button size based on the size of Tux Paint's window (or fullscreen
    display). (For the default screen size of 800x600, it will be the default
    button size: "48".)

    💡 Note: If the chosen button size would cause the buttons to be too large
    for all required UI elements to appear under Tux Paint's chosen window
    size, the largest possible button size will be used. (A note will appear in
    stderr.)



colorsrows=RRESHTA

    How many rows of color palette buttons to show; useful when using a large
    color palette (see "colorfile", above), and/or for use with coarse input
    devices (like eyegaze trackers). "RRESHTA" may be between "1" (the default)
    and "3".




Mi/Tastierë

Kursor

nofancycursors=yes

    This disables the fancy mouse pointer shapes in Tux Paint, and uses your
    environment's normal mouse pointer.

    In some enviornments, the fancy cursors cause problems. Use this option to
    avoid them.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "nofancycursors=no" or "fancycursors=
    yes". In both cases, may be overridden by the command-line option
    "--fancycursors".



hidecursor=yes

    This completely hides the mouse pointer shapes in Tux Paint.

    Kjo është e dobishme në pajisje me ekran me prekje, PC tablet, ta zëmë.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "hidecursor=no" or "showcursor=yes". In
    both cases, may be overridden by the command-line option "--showcursor".




Tastierë

noshortcuts=yes

    This disable keyboard shortcuts (e.g., [Ctrl]-[S] for save, [Ctrl]-[N] for
    a new image, etc.)

    This is useful to prevent unwanted commands from being activated by
    children who aren't experienced with keyboards.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "noshortcuts=no" or "shortcuts=yes". In
    both cases, may be overridden by the command-line option "--shortcuts".




Mi

grab=yes

    Tux Paint will attempt to 'grab' the mouse and keyboard, so that the mouse
    is confined to Tux Paint's window, and nearly all keyboard input is passed
    directly to it.

    This is useful to disable operating system actions that could get the user
    out of Tux Paint [Alt]-[Tab] window cycling, [Ctrl]-[Escape], etc. This is
    especially useful in fullscreen mode.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "grab=no" or "dontgrab=yes". In both
    cases, may be overridden by the command-line option "--dontgrab".



nowheelmouse=yes

    This disables support for the wheel on mice that have it. (Normally, the
    wheel will scroll the selector menu on the right.)

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "nowheelmouse=no" or "wheelmouse=yes".
    In both cases, may be overridden by the command-line option "--wheelmouse".



nobuttondistinction=yes

    Prior to Tux Paint 0.9.15, the middle and right buttons on a mouse could
    also be used for clicking. In version 0.9.15, it was changed so that only
    the left mouse button worked, so as to not train children to use the wrong
    button.

    However, for children who have trouble with the mouse, this distinction
    between the two or three buttons on a mouse can be disabled (returning Tux
    Paint to its old behavior) by using this option.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "nobuttondistinction=no" or
    "buttondistinction=yes". In both cases, may be overridden by the
    command-line option "--buttondistinction".




Thjeshtim

Thjeshtim Ndërfaqeje

simpleshapes=yes

    Disable the rotation step of the 'Shape' tool. Click, drag and release is
    all that will be needed to draw a shape.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "simpleshapes=no" or "complexshapes=
    yes". In both cases, may be overridden by the command-line option
    "--complexshapes".



nooutlines=yes

    In this mode, much simpler outlines and 'rubber-band' lines are displayed
    when using the Lines, Shapes, Stamps and Eraser tools.

    This can help when Tux Paint is run on very slow computers, or displayed on
    a remote X-Window display.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "nooutlines=no" or "outlines=yes". In
    both cases, may be overridden by the command-line option "--outlines".



uppercase=yes

    All text will be rendered only in uppercase (e.g., "Brush" will be
    "BRUSH"). Useful for children who can read, but who have only learned
    uppercase letters so far.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "uppercase=no" or "mixedcase=yes". In
    both cases, may be overridden by the command-line option "--mixedcase".




Madhësi Fillestare Stampe

stampsize=MADHËSI

    Use this option to force Tux Paint to set the starting size of all stamps.
    The MADHËSI value should be between 0 (smallest) and 10 (largest). The size
    is relative to the available sizes of the stamp, which depends on the stamp
    itself, and Tux Paint's current canvas size.

    Specify "default" to let Tux Paint decide (its standard behavior).




Thjeshtim Kontrolli

noquit=yes

    Disable the on-screen "Quit" button and prevent the [Tasti Escape] key from
    quitting Tux Paint.

    Using the [Alt] + [F4] keyboard combination or clicking the window's close
    button (assuming you're not in fullscreen mode) still works to quit Tux
    Paint.

    You can also use the following keyboard combination to quit: [Tasti Shift]
    + [Tasti Kontroll] + [Tasti Escape].

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "noquit=no" or "quit=yes". In both
    cases, may be overridden by the command-line option "--quit".



nostamps=yes

    This option tells Tux Paint to not load any rubber stamp images, which in
    turn ends up disabling the Stamps tool.

    This can speed up Tux Paint when it first loads up, and reduce memory usage
    while it's running. Of course, no stamps will be available at all.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "nostamps=no" or "stamps=yes". In both
    cases, may be overridden by the command-line option "--stamps".



nostampcontrols=yes

    Some images in the Stamps tool can be mirrored, flipped, and/or have their
    size changed. This option disables the controls, and only provides the
    basic stamps.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "nostampcontrols=no" or "stampcontrols=
    yes". In both cases, may be overridden by the command-line option
    "--stampcontrols".



nostamprotation=yes

    This disables the rotation step of the Stamps tool, immediately placing the
    stamp in its regular orientation (with any flipping or mirroring applied)
    on the first click.

    📜 Note: The stamp rotation feature was added to Tux Paint in version
    0.9.29.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "nostamprotation=no" or "stamprotation=
    yes". In both cases, may be overridden by the command-line option
    "--stamprotation".



nomagiccontrols=yes

    Some Magic tools have the option of acting like a paintbrush, or affecting
    the entire canvas at once. This option disables the controls, and only
    provides the default functionality (usually paint-mode).

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "nomagiccontrols=no" or "magiccontrols=
    yes". In both cases, may be overridden by the command-line option
    "--magiccontrols".



nomagicsizes=yes

    Some Magic tools offer various size settings. This option disables the
    sizing control, and only provides the tools' default sizes. (Some plugins
    may offer additional variations of a Magic tool, to make a few sizes
    possible, e.g. "Bricks" and "Googly Eyes".)

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "nomagicsizes=no" or "magicsizes=yes".
    In both cases, may be overridden by the command-line option "--magicsizes".



ungroupmagictools=yes

    By default, the Magic tools in Tux Paint are organized into groups of
    similar tools (e.g., all of the color, saturation, darken/lighten tools
    together). This option removes the grouping, and places all of the tools in
    one long list.

    📜 Note: Magic tool groups were added in Tux Paint 0.9.27. The option to
    disable grouping was added to Tux Paint in version 0.9.33.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "ungroupmagictools=no" or
    "groupmagictools=yes". In both cases, may be overridden by the command-line
    option "--groupmagictools".



noshapecontrols=yes

    Disable the control buttons shown when using the Shapes tool that allow
    changing how shapes are drawn — centered around the initial mouse click, or
    with a corner at the initial mouse click.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "noshapecontrols=no" or "shapecontrols=
    yes". In both cases, may be overridden by the command-line option
    "--shapecontrols".



nolabel=yes

    Disables the Label tool: the tool that allows text entry which can be
    edited later.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "nolabel=no" or "label=yes". In both
    cases, may be overridden by the command-line option "--label".



nobrushspacing=yes

    Disables the brush spacing option of the Paint and Lines tools. The
    brushes' default spacings will be used.

    📜 Note: The brush spacing option was added to Tux Paint's user interface in
    version 0.9.28. For more information on brush spacing, see EXTENDING.html

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "nobrushspacing=no" or "brushspacing=
    yes". In both cases, may be overridden by the command-line option
    "--brushspacing".



complexity=KOMPLEKSITET

    Sets the complexity (expertise) level of Tux Paint, which can either
    disable some Magic tools, or cause them to operate differently. (For
    example, the "Clone" tool is not available in novice mode, and the 1-, 2-,
    and 3-point perspective tools do not allow vanishing points to be edited in
    beginner mode.)

    Vlera e KOMPLEKSITET mund të jetë një nga:

    advanced (parazgjedhja)
        "Advanced" — For users familiar with Tux Paint and who can operate more
        complex tools.

    beginner
        "Beginner" — For users comfortable with Tux Paint, but where complex
        tools may cause confusion or frustration.

    novice
        "Novice" — For first-time Tux Paint users, users inexperienced with
        computers, or those with special accessibility needs.


    📜 Note: The complexity option was added to Tux Paint in version 0.9.32.
    Consult the individual Magic tools' documentation.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "complexity=advanced". In both cases,
    may be overridden by the command-line option "--complexity=advanced".



notemplateexport=yes

    Disables the ability to create a new Template image (based on a saved
    drawing) from within the Open dialog.

    📜 Note: The Template creation feature was added to Tux Paint in version
    0.9.31.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "notemplateexport=no" or
    "templateexport=yes". In both cases, may be overridden by the command-line
    option "--templateexport".



noerase=yes

    Disables the ability to erase saved drawings via the "Erase" button on the
    Open dialog, or exported Template images (based on a saved drawing) via the
    "Erase" button on the New dialog. Useful to prevent users from erasing
    work, especially combined with the --saveovernew option.

    📜 Note: This option was added to Tux Paint in version 0.9.31.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "noerase=no" or "erase=yes". In both
    cases, may be overridden by the command-line option "--erase".

--locale VENDORE

    Run Tux Paint in one of the support languages. See the "Choosing a
    Different Language" section below for the locale strings (e.g., "de_DE" for
    German) to use.

    (If your locale is already set, e.g. with the "$LANG" environment variable,
    this option is not necessary, since Tux Paint honors your environment's
    setting, if possible.)



mirrorstamps=yes

    For stamps that can be mirrored, this option sets them to their mirrored
    shape by default.

    This can be useful for people who prefer things right-to-left, rather than
    left-to-right.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "mirrorstamps=no" or "dontmirrorstamps=
    yes". In both cases, may be overridden by the command-line option
    "--dontmirrorstamps".




Shkronja

sysfonts=yes

    This option causes Tux Paint to attempt to load fonts (for use in the Text
    tool) from your operating system. Normally, Tux Paint will only load the
    ones that came bundled with Tux Paint.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "sysfonts=no" or "nosysfonts=yes". In
    both cases, may be overridden by the command-line option "--nosysfonts".



alllocalefonts=yes

    Prior to version 0.9.21, Tux Paint loaded all fonts in its own fonts
    directory, including locale-specific ones (e.g., the one for Tibetan, which
    had no latin characters). As of 0.9.21, the only font loaded from the
    locale-specific subdirectory, if any, is one matching the locale Tux Paint
    is running on.

    To load all locale-specific fonts (the old behavior), set this option.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "alllocalefonts=no" or
    "currentlocalefont=yes". In both cases, may be overridden by the
    command-line option "--currentlocalefont".



uifont=EMËR LLOJI SHKRONJASH

    This option causes Tux Paint to attempt to load fonts (for use in the Text
    tool) from your operating system. Normally, Tux Paint will only load the
    ones that came bundled with Tux Paint.

    Specify "default" to let Tux Paint use its default font, "DejaVu Sans" (its
    standard behavior).

printdelay=SEKONDA

    Restrict printing so that printing can occur only once every SEKONDA
    seconds.

    ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden by
    the user's configuration file using "printdelay=0". In both cases, may be
    overridden by the command-line option "--printdelay=0".




Shfaq Dialog Shtypësi

altprint=always

    This causes Tux Paint to always show the printer dialog (or, on Linux/Unix,
    run the "altprintcommand") when the 'Print' button is clicked. In other
    words, it's like clicking 'Print' while holding [Alt], except you don't
    need to hold [Alt] every time.



altprint=never

    This prevents Tux Paint from ever showing the printer dialog (or, on Linux/
    Unix, run the "altprintcommand") when the 'Print' button is clicked. In
    other words, it makes the [Alt] key have no effect when clicking the
    'Print' button.



altprint=mod

    This is the normal, default behavior. Tux Paint shows a printer dialog (or,
    on Linux/Unix, runs the "altprintcommand"), when the [Alt] key is pressed
    while the 'Print' button is clicked. Clicking 'Print' without holding [Alt]
    prints without showing a dialog.




Ruaje Formësimin e Shtypësit

    printcfg=yes

        (Vetëm në Windows dhe macOS)

        Tux Paint will use a printer configuration file when printing. Push the
        [Alt] key while clicking the 'Print' button in Tux Paint to cause a
        Windows print dialog window to appear.

        Any configuration changes made in this dialog will be saved to the file
        "userdata/print.cfg" , and used again, as long as the "printcfg" option
        is set.

        💡 Note: This only works when not running Tux Paint in fullscreen mode.

        ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden
        by the user's configuration file using "printcfg=no" or "noprintcfg=
        yes". In both cases, may be overridden by the command-line option
        "--noprintcfg".




    Urdhra Shtypjeje

    printcommand=URDHËR

        (Vetëm në Linux dhe Unix)

        Use the command URDHËR to print a PostScript format file when the
        'Print' button is clicked. If this option is not specifically not set,
        the default command is:

            lpr

        📜 Note: Versions of Tux Paint prior to 0.9.15 sent PNG format data to
        the print command (which defaulted to "pngtopnm | pnmtops | lpr").

        If you set an alternative printcommand in the configuration file prior
        to version 0.9.15, you will need to change it.



    altprintcommand=URDHËR

        (Vetëm në Linux dhe Unix)

        Use the command URDHËR to print a PostScript format file when the
        'Print' button is clicked while the [Alt] modifier key is being held.
        (This is typically used for providing a print dialog, similar to when
        pressing [Alt]+'Print' in Windows and macOS.)

        If this option is not specifically not set, the default command is
        KDE's graphical print dialog:

            kprinter




    Madhësi Letre

    papersize=MADHËSI LETRE

        (Platforms that use Tux Paint's internal PostScript generator — not
        Windows, macOS, BeOS, or Haiku.)

        Tell Tux Paint what size PostScript to generate. If none is specified,
        Tux Paint first checks your $PAPER environment variable, then the file
        /etc/papersize, then uses the the 'libpaper' library's default paper
        size.

        Valid paper sizes include: letter, legal, tabloid, executive, note,
        statement, a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, b0, b1, b2 b3,
        b4, 10x14, 11x17, halfletter, halfexecutive, halfnote, folio, quarto,

    saveover=yes

        This disables the "Save over the old version...?" prompt when saving an
        existing file. With this option, the older version will always be
        replaced by the new version, automatically.



    saveover=new

        This also disables the "Save over the old version...?" prompt when
        saving an existing file. This option, however, will always save a new
        file, rather than overwrite the older version.



    saveover=ask

        (Kjo mundësi është përsëritje e panevojshme, ngaqë kjo është
        parazgjedhja.) When saving an existing drawing, you will be first asked
        whether to save over the older version or not.




    Fillimi

    startblank=yes

        This causes Tux Paint to display a blank canvas when it first starts
        up, rather than loading the last image that was being edited.

        ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden
        by the user's configuration file using "startblank=no" or "startlast=
        yes". In both cases, may be overridden by the command-line option
        "--startlast".



    newcolorslast=yes

        Places the blank color options in the New dialog at the end, so that
        any Starters and/or Templates are shown first.

        ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden
        by the user's configuration file using "newcolorslast=no" or
        "newcolorsfirst=yes". In both cases, may be overridden by the
        command-line option "--newcolorsfirst".

    savedir=DREJTORI

        Use this option to change where Tux Paint's "saved" directory/folder is
        located, which is where Tux Paint saves and opens pictures.

        If you do not override it, the default location is:

        Linux / Unix
            Under a hidden directory in your home directory:
            /home/emër përdoruesi/.tuxpaint/saved/

        Windows
            C:\Users\emër përdoruesi\AppData\Roaming\TuxPaint\saved\

        macOS
            /Users/emër përdoruesi/Library/Application Support/TuxPaint/saved/

        Haiku
            /boot/home/config/settings/TuxPaint/saved/


        💡 Note: When specifying a Windows drive (e.g., "H:\"), you must also
        specify a subdirectory.

        📜 Note: Prior to version 0.9.18, Tux Paint would also use the setting
        or default for "savedir" as the place to search for personal data files
        (brushes, stamps, starters and fonts). As of version 0.9.18, they may
        be specified separately (see the "datadir" option, below).

        Shembull: savedir=Z:\tuxpaint\



    exportdir=DREJTORI

        Use this option to change where Tux Paint exports files — single
        images, or animated GIF slideshows — for external use.

        If you do not override it, the default location is:

          o Linux & Unix — If available, wherever your desktop environment is
            configured for pictures to be stored, based on your XDG (X Desktop
            Group) configuration. (Try running the command-line "xdg-user-dir
            PICTURES" to find out.)
            Typically (in an English locale), this will be a "Foto"
            subdirectory in your home directory (i.e., 
            "/home/emër përdoruesi/Foto").
            Tux Paint will fall back to using that typical directory, if no XDG
            configuration can be read, or nothing is set for
            "XDG_PICTURES_DIR".
          o Windows - "My Pictures" directory for each user (normaly 
            "C:\Users\emër përdoruesi\My Pictures")
            You can directly open the folder as follows:
              # Shtypni “[Windows]+[R]”" që të hapet dialogu “Xhironi …”.
              # Enter "Shell:My Pictures" in the text box and push [OK].
          o macOS — TBD!

        💡 Note: When the defaults are used, a new "TuxPaint" subdirectory will
        be created and used. (e.g., "/home/emër përdoruesi/Foto/TuxPaint") When
        the "--exportdir" option is used, the exact path specified will be used
        (no "TuxPaint" subdirectory is created).

        The directory itself (e.g., "/home/emër përdoruesi/Foto/TuxPaint") will
        be created, if it doesn't exist.

        If the parent directory (e.g., "/home/emër përdoruesi/Foto") also does
        not exist, Tux Paint will attempt to create it as well (but not any
        directories higher than that).

    nosave=yes

        This disables Tux Paint's ability to save files (and therefore disables
        the on-screen "Save" button). It can be used in situations where the
        program is only being used for fun, or in a test environment.

        ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden
        by the user's configuration file using "nosave=no" or "save=yes". In
        both cases, may be overridden by the command-line option "--save".



    autosave=yes

        This prevents Tux Paint from asking whether you want to save the
        current picture when quitting, and assumes you do.

        ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden
        by the user's configuration file using "autosave=no" or "noautosave=
        yes". In both cases, may be overridden by the command-line option
        "--noautosave".



    reversesort=yes

        This reverses the sorting of the Open and Slideshow dialogs, placing
        the newest images at the top of the list.

        ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden
        by the user's configuration file using "reversesort=no" or
        "noreversesort=yes". In both cases, may be overridden by the
        command-line option "--noreversesort".




    Të dhëna

    Lockfile

    nolockfile=yes

        By default, Tux Paint uses what's known as a 'lockfile' to prevent it
        from being launched more than once in 30 seconds. (This is to avoid
        accidentally running multiple copies; for example, by double-clicking a
        single-click launcher, or simply impatiently clicking the icon multiple
        times.)

        To make Tux Paint ignore the lockfile, allowing it to run again, even
        if it was just launched less than 30 seconds ago, enable this setting
        in the configuration file, or run Tux Paint with the --nolockfile
        option on the command-line.

        By default, the lockfile is stored in "~/.tuxpaint/" under Linux and
        Unix, and "userdata\" under Windows.

        ⚙ Note: If used in a system-wide configuration file, may be overridden
        by the user's configuration file using "nolockfile=no" or "lockfile=
        yes". In both cases, may be overridden by the command-line option
        "--lockfile".

    datadir=DREJTORI

        Use this option to change where Tux Paint looks for personal data files
        (brushes, stamps, starters, templates, and fonts specific to the
        current user).

        Tux Paint will search for subdirectories/subfolders named "brushes",
        "stamps", "starters", "templates", and "fonts" under the specified data
        directory.

        If you do not override it, the default location is:

        Linux / Unix
            /home/emër përdoruesi/.tuxpaint/

        📜 Note: Prior to version 0.9.18, Tux Paint would use the same setting
        or default as for "savedir" to search for data files. As of version
        0.9.18, they may be specified separately.

        💡 Note: When specifying a Windows drive (e.g., "H:\"), you must also
        specify a subdirectory.

    Kartelë Palete Ngjyrash

    colorfile=EMËR KARTELE

        You may override Tux Paint's default color palette by creating a plain
        ASCII text file that describes the colors you want, and pointing to
        that file using the "colorfile" option.

        The file should list one color per line. Colors are defined in terms of
        their Red, Green and Blue values, each from 0 (off) to 255 (brightest).
        (For more information, try Wikipedia's "RGB color model" article.)

        Colors may be listed using three decimal numbers (e.g., "255 68 136")
        or a 6- or 3-digit-long hexadecimal 'triplet' (e.g., "#ff4488" or "#
        F48").

        After the color definition (on the same line) you may enter text to
        describe the color. Tux will display this text when the color is
        clicked. (For example, "#FFF E bardhë si bora.")

        As an example, you can see the default colors currently used in Tux
        Paint in: "default_colors.txt".

        NOTES: You must separate decimal values with spaces, and begin
        hexadecimal values with a pound/number-sign character ("#"). In 3-digit
        hexadecimal, each digit is used for both the high and low halves of the
        byte, so "#FFF" is the same as "#FFFFFF", not "#F0F0F0".

    If any of the above options are set in a system-wide configuration file
    (e.g. "/etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.conf" on Linux), you may override them in
    your own personal configuration file (e.g. 
    "/home/emër përdoruesi/.tuxpaintrc")

    For true/false options, like "noprint" and "grab", you can simply say they
    equal 'no' in your personal configuration file:

        noprint=no
        uppercase=no

    Or, you can use options similar to the command-line override options
    described below. For example:

        print=yes
        mixedcase=yes

    Options may also be issued on the command-line when you go to launch Tux

        These options can be used to override any settings made in the
        configuration file. (If the option isn't set in the configuration file
        (s), no overriding option is necessary.)



    --nosysconfig

        This prevents the system-wide configuration file (e.g. 
        "/etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.conf" on Linux), from being read.

        Only your own configuration file (e.g. 
        "/home/emër përdoruesi/.tuxpaintrc" on Linux) — if it exists — will be
        used.

    Tux Paint has been translated into a number of languages. To access the
    translations, you can use the "--lang" option on the command-line to set
    the language (e.g. "--lang spanish") or use the "lang=" setting in the
    configuration file (e.g., "lang=spanish").

    Tux Paint also honors your environment's current locale. (You can override
    it on the command-line using the "--locale" option; see above.)

    Use the option "--lang help" to list the language options available.

    (*) - These languages require their own fonts, since they are not
    represented using a Latin character set, like the others. See the "Special
    Fonts" section, below.

    💡 Note: Tux Paint provides an alternative input method for entering
    characters with the Text tool in some locales. The key comibation(s) listed
    can be used to cycle through the supported input methods while the Text
    tool is active.

    Changing your locale will affect much of your environment.

    As stated above, along with letting you choose the language at runtime
    using command-line options ("--lang" and "--locale"), Tux Paint honors the
    global locale setting in your environment.

    If you haven't already set your environment's locale, the following will
    briefly explain how:

    Përdorues të Linux-it/Unix-it

    First, be sure the locale you want to use is enabled by editing the file "/
    etc/locale.gen" on your system and then running the program "locale-gen" as
    root.

    💡 Note: Debian users may be able to simply run the command
    "dpkg-reconfigure locales" as root to bring up a configuration dialog.
    Ubuntu users may be able to run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure localeconf" (the
    "localeconf" package may need to be installed first), or you may need to
    edit the file "/var/lib/locales/supported.d/local" first, and add locales
    they want, from the list found in "/usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED".

    Then, before running Tux Paint, set your "$LANG" environment variable to
    one of the locales listed above. (If you want all programs that can be
    translated to be, you may wish to place the following in your login script;
    e.g. "~/.profile", "~/.bashrc", "~/.cshrc", etc.)

    For example, in a Bourne Shell (like BASH):

        export LANG=es_ES ; \
        tuxpaint

    Dhe në një shell C (TCSH, ta zëmë):

        setenv LANG es_ES ; \
        tuxpaint

    Përdorues Windows-i

    Tux Paint will recognize the current locale and use the appropriate files
    by default. So this section is only for people trying different languages.

    The simplest thing to do is to use the "--lang" switch in the shortcut (see
    "INSTALL"). However, by using an MSDOS Prompt window, it is also possible
    to issue a command like this:

        set LANG=es_ES

    ...which will set the language for the lifetime of that DOS window.

    For something more permanent, you can set an 'environment variable' using
    the "Veti sistemi" dialogue as follows:

      + Shtypni ndërthurjen e tasteve “[Windows]+[R]”" që të hapet dialogu
        “Xhironi …”.
      + Enter "sysdm.cpl" in the text box and click the "[OK]" button to open
        the "Veti sistemi" dialogue.
      + Përzgjidhni skedën “Të mëtejshme”.
      + Klikoni butonin “Ndryshore Mjedisi…”.
      + Edit the value of the parameter "LANG" (create it, if it doesn't
        exists).
   
    Shkronja Speciale

    Some languages require special fonts be installed. These font files (which
    are in TrueType format (TTF)), are much too large to include with the Tux
    Paint download, and are available separately. (See the table above, under
    the "Choosing a Different Language" section.)

    📜 Note: As of version 0.9.18, Tux Paint uses the "SDL_Pango" library, which
    utilizes the "Pango" library to render text in the user interface, rather
    than using "SDL_ttf" directly. Unless your copy of Tux Paint was built
    without Pango support, special fonts should no longer be necessary.

    When running Tux Paint in a language that requires its own font, Tux Paint
    will try to load the font file from its system-wide "fonts" directory
    (under a "locale" subdirectory). The name of the file corresponds to the
    first two letters in the 'locale' code of the language (e.g., "ko" for
    Korean, "ja" for Japanese, "zh_tw" for Traditional Chinese).

    For example, under Linux or Unix, when Tux Paint is run in Korean (e.g.,
    with the option "--lang korean"), Tux Paint will attempt to load the
    following font file:

        /usr/share/tuxpaint/fonts/locale/ko.ttf

    You can download fonts for supported languages from Tux Paint's website,
    https://tuxpaint.org/. (Look in the 'Fonts' section under 'Download.')

    Under Unix and Linux, you can use the Makefile that comes with the font to
    install the font in the appropriate location.
