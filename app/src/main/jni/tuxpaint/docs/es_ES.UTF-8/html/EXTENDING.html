      If you wish to add or change things like Brushes, Starters, Rubber Stamps, and other content used by Tux Paint, you can do so fairly easily by simply adding, changing, or removing files where Tux Paint looks for them.    </p>

    <p>
      Note: You'll need to re-launch Tux Paint for the changes to take effect.    </p>

            Tux Paint stores its data files inside the "Tux Paint" application icon (which is actually a special kind of folder on macOS &amp; Mac OS X before it). The following steps explain how to get to the folders within it:          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Bring up a 'context' menu by holding the <b>[Control]</b> key and clicking the Tux Paint icon the in <cite>Finder</cite>. (If you have a mouse with more than one button, you can simply right-click the icon.)            </li>

            <li>Select "Show Contents" from the menu that appears. A new <cite>Finder</cite> window will appear with a folder inside called "Contents".            </li>

            <li>Open the "Contents" folder and open the "Resources" folder found inside.            </li>

            <li>There, you will find various sub-folders, such as "starters", "stamps", "brushes", etc. Adding new content to these folders will make the content available to any user that launches this copy (icon) of Tux Paint.            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            <em>Note:</em> If you install a newer version of Tux Paint and replace or discard the old version, you will lose changes made by following the instructions above, so keep backups of your new content (stamps, brushes, etc.).          </p>

          <p>
            Tux Paint also looks for files in a "TuxPaint" folder that you can place in your system's "Application Support" folder (found under "Library" at the root of your filesystem):          </p>

          <p>
            When you upgrade to a newer version of Tux Paint, the contents of this "TuxPaint" folder will stay the same, and remain accessible by all users of Tux Paint.          </p>

        The brushes used for drawing with the 'Brush' and 'Lines' tools in Tux Paint are simply PNG image files.      </p>

      <p>
        The alpha (transparency) of the PNG image is used to determine the shape of the brush, which means that the shape can be 'anti-aliased' and even partially-transparent!      </p>

      <p>
        Greyscale pixels in the brush PNG will be drawn using the currently-selected color in Tux Paint. Color pixels will be tinted.      </p>

      <h3>
        <a name="brush_options"
            id="brush_options">Brush Options</a>
      </h3>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Aside from a graphical shape, brushes can also be given other attributes. To do this, you need to create a 'data file' for the brush.        </p>

        <p>
          A brush's data file is simply a plain ASCII text file containing the options for the brush.        </p>

        <p>
          The file has the same name as the PNG image, but a "<code>.dat</code>" extension. (e.g., "<code>brush.png</code>"'s data file is the text file "<code>brush.dat</code>", found in the same directory.)        </p>

        <h4>
          Brush Spacing        </h4>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            As of Tux Paint version 0.9.16, you can now specify the spacing for brushes (that is, how often they are drawn). By default, the spacing will be the brush's height, divided by 4.          </p>

          <p>
            Add a line containing the line "<code><b>spacing=<i>N</i></b></code>" to the brush's data file, where "<i>N</i>" is the spacing you want for the brush. (The lower the number, the more often the brush is drawn.)          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <h4>
          Animated Brushes        </h4>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            As of Tux Paint version 0.9.16, you may now create animated brushes. As the brush is used, each frame of the animation is drawn.          </p>

          <p>
            Lay each frame out across a wide PNG image. For example, if your brush is 30x30 and you have 5 frames, the image should be 150x30.          </p>

          <p>
            Add a line containing the line "<code><b>frames=<i>N</i></b></code>" to the brush's data file, where "<i>N</i>" is the number of frames in the brush.          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Note:</b> If you'd rather the frames be flipped through randomly, rather than sequentially, also add a line containing "<code><b>random</b></code>" to the brush's data file.          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <h4>
          Directional Brushes        </h4>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            As of Tux Paint version 0.9.16, you may now create directional brushes. As the brush is used, different shapes are drawn, depending on the direction the brush is going.          </p>

          <p>
            The directional shapes are divided into a 3x3 square in a PNG image. For example, if your brush is 30x30, the image should be 90x90, and each of the direction's shapes placed in a 3x3 grid. The center region is used for no motion. The top right is used for motion that's both up, and to the right. And so on.          </p>

          <p>
            Add a line containing the word "<code><b>directional</b></code>" to the brush's data file.          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <h4>
          Animated Directional Brushes        </h4>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            You may mix both animated and directional features into one brush. Use both options ("<code><b>frames=<i>N</i></b></code>" and "<code><b>directional</b></code>"), in separate lines in the brush's "<code>.dat</code>" file.          </p>

          <p>
            Lay the brush out so that each 3x3 set of directional shapes are laid out across a wide PNG image. For example, if the brush is 30x30 and there are 5 frames, it would be 450x90. (The leftmost 150x90 pixels of the image represent the 9 direction shapes for the first frame, for example.)          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Place the brush image PNGs (and any data text files) in the "<code><b>brushes</b></code>" directory.      </p>

      <p>
        Note: If your new brushes all come out as solid squares or rectangles, it's because you forgot to use alpha transparency! See the 'PNG documentation' in Tux Paint for more information and tips.      </p>

          As of Tux Paint version 0.9.17, Stamps may be either PNG bitmap images or SVG vector images. They can be full-color or greyscale. The alpha (transparency) channel of PNGs is used to determine the actual shape of the picture (otherwise you'll stamp a large rectangle on your drawings).        </p>

        <p>
          PNGs can be any size, and Tux Paint (by default) provides a set of sizing buttons to let the user scale the stamp up (larger) and down (smaller).        </p>

        <p>
          SVGs are vector-based, and will be scaled appropriately for the canvas size being used in Tux Paint.        </p>

        <p>
        Note: If your new PNG-based stamps all come out as solid squares or rectangles, it's because you forgot to use alpha transparency! See the 'PNG documentation' in Tux Paint for more information and tips.        </p>

        <p>
          Note: If your new SVG stamps seem to have a lot of whitespace, make sure the SVG 'document' is no larger than the shape(s) within. If they are being clipped, make sure the 'document' is large enough to contain the shape(s). See the 'SVG documentation' in Tux Paint for more information and tips.        </p>

Files may be in "WAVE ("<code>.wav</code>")" or "OGG Vorbis ("<code>.ogg</code>")" formats, and are given same name as the PNG or SVG image.

          <p>
            By default, a stamp can be flipped upside down, shown as a mirror image, or both. This is done using the control buttons below the stamp selector, at the lower right side of the screen in Tux Paint.          </p>

          <p>
            Sometimes, it doesn't make sense for a stamp to be flippable or mirrored; for example, stamps of letters or numbers. Sometimes stamps are symmetrical, so letting the user flip or mirror them isn't useful.          </p>

          <p>
            To prevent a stamp from being flipped vertically, add the option "<code><b>noflip</b></code>" to the stamp's data file.          </p>

          <p>
            To prevent a stamp from being mirrored horizontally, add the option "<code><b>nomirror</b></code>" to the stamp's data file.          </p>

        <h4>
          Initial Stamp Size        </h4>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            By default, Tux Paint assumes that your stamp is sized appropriately for unscaled display on a 608x472 canvas. This was the original Tux Paint canvas size, provided by a 640x480 screen. Tux Paint will then adjust the stamp according to the current canvas size and, if enabled, the user's stamp size controls.          </p>

          <p>
            If your stamp would be too big or too small, you can specify a scale factor. If your stamp would be 2.5 times as wide (or tall) as it should be, add one of the following options, which represent the same adjustment, to the stamp's data file. (An equals sign, "<code>=</code>", may be included after the word "<code>scale</code>".)          </p>

      </h3>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          In some cases, you may wish to provide a pre-drawn version of a stamp's mirror-image, flipped image, or even both. For example, imagine a picture of a fire truck with the words "<cite>Fire Department</cite>" written across the side. You probably do not want that text to appear backwards when the image is flipped!        </p>

        <p>
          To create a mirrored version of a stamp that you want Tux Paint to use, rather than mirroring one on its own, simply create a second "<code>.png</code>" or "<code>.svg</code>" graphics file with the same name, except with "<code><b>_mirror</b></code>" before the filename extension.        </p>

        <p>
          For example, for the stamp "<code>stamp.png</code>" you would create another file named "<code>stamp_mirror.png</code>", which will be used when the stamp is mirrored (rather than using a backwards version of "<code>stamp.png</code>").        </p>

        <p>
          As of Tux Paint 0.9.18, you may similarly provide a pre-flipped image with "<code><b>_flip</b></code>" in the name, and/or an image that is both mirrored and flipped, by naming it "<code><b>_mirror_flip</b></code>".        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Note:</b> If the user flips and mirrors an image, and a pre-drawn "<code>_mirror_flip</code>" doesn't exist, but either "<code>_flip</code>" or "<code>_mirror</code>" does, it will be used, and mirrored or flipped, respectively.        </p>

        <p>
          The most basic kind of 'starter' is similar to a picture in a coloring book. It's an outline of a shape which you can then color in and add details to. In Tux Paint, as you draw, type text, or stamp stamps, the outline remains 'above' what you draw. You can erase the parts of the drawing you made, but you can't erase the outline.        </p>

        <p>
          To create this kind of 'starter' image, simply create an outlined black and white picture in a paint program, and save it as a raster PNG file, or vector SVG.  If saving as a PNG, you may optionally render the image as black-and-transparent, rather than black-and-white, but (as of Tux Paint 0.9.21) this is not required.        </p>

        <p>
          Along with the 'coloring-book' style overlay, you can also provide a separate background image as part of a 'starter' picture. The overlay acts the same: it can't be drawn over, erased, or affected by 'Magic' tools. However, the background can be!        </p>

        <p>
          When the 'Eraser' tool is used on a picture based on this kind of 'starter' image, rather than turning the canvas to a solid color, such as white, it returns that part of the canvas to the original background picture from the 'starter' image.        </p>

        <p>
          By creating both an overlay and a background, you can create a 'starter' which simulates depth. Imagine a background that shows the ocean, and an overlay that's a picture of a reef. You can then draw (or stamp) fish in the picture. They'll appear in the ocean, but never 'in front of' the reef.        </p>

        <p>
          To create this kind of 'starter' picture, simply create an overlay (with transparency) and save it as a PNG. Then create another image (without transparency), and save it with the same filename, but with "<code>-back</code>" (short for 'background') appended to the name. (e.g., "<code>starter-back.png</code>" would be the background ocean picture that corresponds to the overlay, or foreground.)        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        For best results, 'starter' images should be at least the same size as Tux Paint's drawing canvas. (See the "Loading Other Pictures into Tux Paint" section of Tux Paint's main documentation (README) for details on sizing.) If they are not, they will be stretched or scaled.  This is done without affecting the shape ("aspect ratio"); however some smudging may be applied to the edges.      </p>

      <p>
        Place them in the "<code><b>starters</b></code>" directory. When the 'New' dialog is accessed in Tux Paint, the 'starter' images will appear in the screen that appears, after the various solid color choices.      </p>

        <b>Note:</b> 'Starters' are 'attached' to saved pictures, via a small text file that has the same name as the saved file, but with "<code>.dat</code>" as the extension.

        Open the newly-created "<code>.po</code>" file — you can edit in a <i>plain</i> text edtior, such as Emacs, Pico or VI on Linux, or NotePad on Windows. The original English text used in Tux Paint is listed in lines starting with "<code>msgid</code>". Enter your translations of each of these pieces of text in the empty "<code>msgstr</code>" lines directly below the corresponding "<code>msgid</code>" lines. (<i>Note:</i> Do not remove the quotes.)      </p>

      <p>
        Example:      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <code>msgid "Smudge"<br>
          msgstr "<u>Manchar</u>"<br>
          <br>
          msgid "Click and drag to draw large bricks."<br>
          msgstr "<u>Haz clic y arrastra para dibujar ladrillos grandes.</u>"</code>
        </p>

        Various tools exist to manage gettext translation catalogs, so you don't have to edit them by hand in a text editor. Here are a few:      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Note:</i> It is best to always work off of the <i>latest</i> Tux Paint text catalog template ("<code>tuxpaint.pot</code>"), since new text is added, and old text is occasionally changed. The text catalog for the upcoming, unreleased version of Tux Paint can be found in Tux Paint's Git repository (see: <a href="http://www.tuxpaint.org/download/source/git/">http://www.tuxpaint.org/download/source/git/</a>), and on the Tux Paint website at <a href="http://www.tuxpaint.org/help/po/">http://www.tuxpaint.org/help/po/</a>.      </p>

        You may send new or edited translation files to Bill Kendrick, lead developer of Tux Paint, at: <a href="mailto:bill@newbreedsoftware.com">bill@newbreedsoftware.com</a>, or post them to the "tuxpaint-i18n" mailing list (see: <a href="http://www.tuxpaint.org/lists/">http://www.tuxpaint.org/lists/</a>).      </p>

        <i>Note:</i> Support for new locales requires making additions to Tux Paint's source code ("<code>/src/i18n.h</code>" and "<code>/src/i18n.c</code>"), and requires updates to the <code>Makefile</code>, to ensure the "<code>.po</code>" files are compiled into "<code>.mo</code>" files, and available for use at runtime.      </p>

      <a name="input_methods"
          id="input_methods">Alternative Input Methods</a>
    </h2>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Tux Paint's 'Text' and 'Label' tools can provide alternative input methods for some languages. For example, when Tux Paint is running with a Japanese locale, the right <b><code>[Alt]</code></b> key can be pressed to cycle between Latin, Romanized Hiragana and Romanized Katakana modes. This allows native characters and words to be entered into the 'Text' and 'Label' tools by typing one or more keys on a keyboard with Latin characters (e.g., a <i>US QWERTY</i> keyboard).      </p>

      <p>
        To create an input method for a new locale, create a text file with a name based on the locale (e.g., "<code>ja</code>" for Japanese), with "<code>.im</code>" as the extension (e.g., "<code>ja.im</code>").      </p>

      <p>
        The "<code>.im</code>" file can have multiple character mapping sections for different character mapping modes. For example, on a Japanese typing system, typing <b><code>[K]</code></b> <b><code>[A]</code></b> in Hiragana mode generates a different Unicode character ("&#12363;") than typing <b><code>[K]</code></b> <b><code>[A]</code></b> in Katakana mode ("&#12459;").      </p>

      <p>
        List the character mappings in this file, one per line. Each line should contain (separated by whitespace):      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>the Unicode value of the character, in hexadecimal (more than one character can be listed, separated by a colon (':'), this allowing some sequences to map to words)        </li>

        <li>the keycode sequence (the ASCII characters that must be entered to generate the Unicode character)        </li>

        <li>a flag (or "<code>-</code>" if none)        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Start additional character mapping sections with a line containign the word "<code>section</code>".      </p>

      <p>
        Example:      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <code># Hiragana<br>
          304B ka -<br>
          304C ga -<br>
          304D ki -<br>
          304E gi -<br>
          304D:3083 kya -<br>

          30AB ka -<br>
          30AC ga -<br>
          30AD ki -<br>
          30AE gi -</code>
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        <i>Note:</i> Blank lines within the "<code>.im</code>" file will be ignored, as will any text following a "<code>#</code>" (pound/hash) character — it can be used to denote comments, as seen in the example above.      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Note:</i> Meanings of the flags are locale-specific, and are processed by the language-specific source code in "<code>src/im.c</code>". For example, "<code>b</code>" is used in Korean to handle Batchim, which may carry over to the next character.      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Note:</i> Support for new input methods requires making additions to Tux Paint's source code ("<code>/src/im.c</code>"), and requires updates to the <code>Makefile</code>, to ensure the "<code>.im</code>" files are available for use at runtime.      </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        As of version 0.9.22, Tux Paint's 'Text' and 'Label' tools can present an on-screen keyboard that allows the pointer (via a mouse, eye-tracking systems, etc.) to be used to input characters. Files that describe the layout and available keys are stored in Tux Paint "<code>osk</code>" directory. Each keyboard layout is defined by a number of files (some of which may be shared by different layouts).      </p>
