      <h2>
        What Is "Tux Paint"?      </h2>
    <header>

    <p>
      Tux Paint is a free drawing program designed for young children (kids ages 3 and up). It has a simple, easy-to-use interface, fun sound effects, and an encouraging cartoon mascot who helps guide children as they use the program. It provides a blank canvas and a variety of drawing tools to help your child be creative.    </p>

      <h2>
        License      </h2>
    </header>

    <p>
      Tux Paint is an Open Source project, Free Software released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). It is free, and the 'source code' behind the program is available. (This allows others to add features, fix bugs, and use parts of the program in their own GPL'd software.)    </p>

          <strong>Easy and Fun</strong>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          Tux Paint is meant to be a simple drawing program for young children. It is not meant as a general-purpose drawing tool. It <em>is</em> meant to be fun and easy to use. Sound effects and a cartoon character help let the user know what's going on, and keeps them entertained. There are also extra-large cartoon-style mouse pointer shapes.        </dd>
      </div>

        <dt>
          <strong>Extensibility</strong>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          Tux Paint is extensible. Brushes and 'rubber stamp' shapes can be dropped in and pulled out. For example, a teacher can drop in a collection of animal shapes and ask their students to draw an ecosystem. Each shape can have a sound which is played, and textual facts which are displayed, when the child selects the shape.        </dd>
      </div>

        <dt>
          <strong>Portability</strong>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          Tux Paint is portable among various computer platforms: Windows, Macintosh, Linux, etc. The interface looks the same among them all. Tux Paint runs suitably well on older systems, and can be built to run better on slow systems.        </dd>
      </div>

          <strong>Simplicity</strong>

        <dd>
          There is no direct access to the computer's underlying intricacies. The current image is kept when the program quits, and reappears when it is restarted. Saving images requires no need to create filenames or use the keyboard. Opening an image is done by selecting it from a collection of thumbnails. Access to other files on the computer is restricted.        </dd>

    <p>
      If you installed Tux Paint on your computer using the 'Tux Paint Installer,' it will have asked you whether you wanted a 'Start' menu short-cut, and/or a desktop shortcut. If you agreed, you can simply run Tux Paint from the 'Tux Paint' section of your 'Start' menu (e.g., under 'All Programs'), or by double-clicking the 'Tux Paint' icon on your desktop, if you had the installer place one there.    </p>

    <p>
      If you're using the 'portable' (ZIP-file) version of Tux Paint, or if you used the 'Tux Paint Installer,' but chose not to have shortcuts installed, you'll need to double-click the "<code>tuxpaint.exe</code>" icon in the "<code>Tux Paint</code>" folder on your computer.    </p>

    <p>
      By default, the 'Tux Paint Installer' will put Tux Paint's folder in "<code>C:\Program Files\</code>", though you may have changed this when you ran the installer.    </p>

    <p>
      If you used the 'ZIP-file' download, Tux Paint's folder will be wherever you extracted the contents of the ZIP file.    </p>

          When the active tool supports colors, a palette of colors choices will be shown near the bottom of the screen. Click one to choose a color, and it will be used by the active tool. (For example, the "Paint" tool will use it as the color to draw with the chosen brush, and the "Fill" tool will use it as the color to use when flood-filling an area of the picture.)        </p>

          On the far right are three special color options:          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Color Picker</strong><br/>
              The "color picker" (which has an outline of an eye-dropper) allows you to pick a color found within your drawing.<br/>
              (A shortcut key is available to access this feature quickly; see below.)            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Rainbow Palette</strong><br/>
              The rainbow palette allows you to pick any color by choosing the hue, saturation, and value of the color you want.              A box on the left displays hundreds of hues &mdash; from red at the top through to violet at the bottom &mdash; at hundreds of saturation/intensity levels &mdash; from pale &amp; washed-out on the left through to pure on the right. A grey vertical bar provides access to hundreds of value levels &mdash; from lighest at the top through to darkest at the bottom.<br/>
              Click the green checkbox button to select the color, or the "Back" button to dismiss the pop-up without picking a new color.              <div class="screenshot-center">

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Color Mixer</strong><br/>
              The "color mixer" (which has silhouette of a paint palette) allows you to create colors by blending primary additive colors &mdash; red, yellow, and blue &mdash; along with white (to "tint"), grey (to "tone"), and black (to "shade").<br/>
              You may click any button multiple times (for example, <span class="white-space: nowrap;">red + red + yellow</span> results in a red-orange color). The ratios of colors added are shown at the bottom.<br/>
              You can start over (reset to no colors in your picture) by clicking the "Clear" button. You can also undo or redo multiple steps of mixing, in case you made a mistake (without having to start over).<br/>
              Click the green checkbox button to select the color, or the "Back" button to dismiss the pop-up without picking a new color.              <div class="screenshot-center">

        <p class="note">
          <span title="Keyboard shortcut">&#9000;</span>          When the active tool supports colors, a shortcut may be used to access the "color picker" option more quickly. Hold the <b><code>[Control]</code></b> key while clicking, and the color under the mouse cursor will be shown at the bottom. You may drag around to canvas to find the color you want. When you release the mouse button, the color under the cursor will be selected. If you release the mouse outside of the canvas (e.g., over the "Tools" area), the color selection will be left unchanged.

    The Paint Brush tool lets you draw freehand, using various brushes (chosen in the Selector on the right) and colors (chosen in the Color palette towards the bottom).  </p>

  <p>
    If you hold the mouse button down, and move the mouse, it will draw as you move.  </p>

  <p>
    Some brushes are animated &mdash; they change their shape as you draw them.  A good example of this is the vines brush that ships with Tux Paint.  These brushes will have a small "filmstrip" icon drawn on their Selector buttons.  </p>

  <p>
    Other brushes are directional &mdash; they will draw a different shape depending on what direction you are painting with them.  An example of this is the arrow brush that ships with Tux Paint.  These brushes have a small 8-way arrow icon drawn on their Selector buttons.  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, some brushes can be both direction <em>and</em> animated.  Examples of this are the cat and squirrel brushes that ship with Tux Paint.  These brushes will have both the "filmstrip" and 8-way arrow icons.  </p>

  <p>
    As you draw, a sound is played. The bigger the brush, the lower the pitch.  </p>

  <strong>Brush Spacing</strong>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The space between each position where a brush is applied to the canvas can vary.  Some brushes (such as the footprints and flower) are spaced, by default, far enough apart that they don't overlap.  Other brushes (such as the basic circular ones) are spaced closely, so they make a continuous stroke.    </p>
    <p>
      The default spacing of brushes may be overridden using by clicking within the triangular-shaped series of bars at the bottom right; the larger the bar, the wider the spacing. Brush spacing affects both tools that use the brushes: the "Paint" tool and the "Lines" tool.    </p>

    This tool lets you draw straight lines using the various brushes and colors you normally use with the Paint Brush.  </p>

  <p>
    Click the mouse and hold it to choose the starting point of the line. As you move the mouse around, a thin 'rubber-band' line will show where the line will be drawn. At the bottom, you'll see the angle of your line, in degrees. A line going straight to the right is 0°, a line going straight up is 90°, a line going straight left is 180°, a line going straight down is 270°, and so on.  </p>

  <p>
    Let go of the mouse to complete the line. A "sproing!" sound will play.  </p>

    Different brushes have different spacing, leaving either a series of individual shapes, or a continuous stroke of the brush shape. Brush spacing may be adjusted. See "Paint", above, to learn more.  </p>

    In the canvas, click the mouse and hold it to stretch the shape out from where you clicked. Some shapes can change proportion (e.g., rectangle and oval may be wider than tall, or taller than wide), others cannot (e.g., square and circle).  </p>

  <p>
    For shapes that can change proportion, the aspect ratio of the shape will be shown at the bottom.  For example: "1:1" will be shown if it is "square" (as tall as it is wide); "2:1" if it is either twice as wide as it is tall, or twice as tall as it is wide; and so on.  </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>Text</strong> tool is the original text-entry tool in Tux Paint. Text entered using this tool can't be modified or moved later, since it becomes part of the drawing. However, because the text becomes part of the picture, it can be drawn over or modified using <strong>Magic</strong> tool effects (e.g., smudged, tinted, embossed, etc.)      </p>

      <p>
        When using the <strong>Label</strong> tool (which was added to Tux Paint in version 0.9.22), the text 'floats' over the image, and the details of the label (the text, the position of the label, the font choice and the color) get stored separately. This allows the label to be repositioned or edited later.      </p>

      <p>
        To edit a label, click the label selection button. All labels in the drawing will appear highlighted. Click one &mdash; or use the <strong><code>[Tab]</code></strong> key to cycle through all the labels, and the <strong><code>[Enter]</code></strong> or <strong><code>[Return]</code></strong> key to select one &mdash; and you may then edit the label. (Use they <strong><code>[Backspace]</code></strong> key to erase characters, and other keys to add text to the label; click in the canvas to reposition the label; click in the palette to change the color of the text in the label; etc.)      </p>

      <p>
        You may "apply" a label to the canvas, painting the text into the picture as if it had been added using the <strong>Text</strong> tool, by clicking the label application button. (This feature was added in Tux Paint version 0.9.28.) All labels in the drawing will appear highlighted, and you select one just as you do when selecting a label to edit. The chosen label will be removed, and the text will be added directly to the canvas.      </p>

      <p class="note">
        <span title="Configuration option">&#9881;</span>        The <strong>Label</strong> tool can be disabled (e.g., by selecting "Disable 'Label' Tool" in <em>Tux Paint Config.</em> or running <em>Tux Paint</em> with the "<code>nolabel</code>" option).      </p>

      <p>
        Tux Paint allows inputting characters in different languages. Most Latin characters (<em>A</em>-<em>Z</em>, <em>ñ</em>, <em>è</em>, etc.) can by entered directly. Some languages require that Tux Paint be switched into an alternate input mode before entering, and some characters must be composed using numerous keypresses.      </p>

      <p>
        When Tux Paint's locale is set to one of the languages that provide alternate input modes, a key is used to cycle through normal (Latin character) and locale-specific mode or modes.      </p>

      <p>
        Currently supported locales, the input methods available, and the key to toggle or cycle modes, are listed below.      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Japanese — Romanized Hiragana and Romanized Katakana — right <code><b>[Alt]</b></code> key or left <code><b>[Alt]</b></code> key        </li>

        <li>Korean — Hangul 2-Bul — right <code><b>[Alt]</b></code> key or left <code><b>[Alt]</b></code> key        </li>

      'Starters' can behave like a page from a coloring book — a black-and-white outline of a picture, which you can then color in, and the black outline remains intact — or like a 3D photograph, where you draw in between a foreground and background layer.    </p>

    <p>
      'Templates' are similar, but simply provide a background drawing to work off of. Unlike 'Starters', there is no layer that remains in the foreground of anything you draw in the picture.    </p>

    <p>
      When using the 'Eraser' tool, the original image from the 'Starter' or 'Template' will reappear. The 'Flip' and 'Mirror' Magic tools affect the orientation of the 'Starter' or 'Template', as well.    </p>

    <p>
      When you load a 'Starter' or 'Template', draw on it, and then click 'Save,' it creates a new picture file — it doesn't overwrite the original, so you can use it again later (by accessing it from the 'New' dialog).    </p>

        Tux Paint prints by generating a PostScript representation of the drawing and sending it to an external program. By default, the program is:      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <code>lpr</code>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This command can be changed by setting a "<code>printcommand</code>" option in Tux Paint's configuration file.      </p>

      <p>
        An alternative print command can be invoked by holding the "<b><code>[Alt]</code></b>" key on the keyboard while clicking clicking the 'Print' button, as long as you're not in fullscreen mode, an alternative program is run. By default, the program is KDE's graphical print dialog:      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <code>kprinter</code>
      </blockquote>

        This command can be changed by setting a "<code>altprintcommand</code>" option in Tux Paint's configuration file.      </p>

        By default, Tux Paint simply prints to the default printer with default settings when the 'Print' button is pushed.      </p>

        However, if you hold the <b><code>[Alt]</code></b> (or <b><code>[Option]</code></b>) key on the keyboard while clicking the 'Print' button, as long as you're not in fullscreen mode, your operating system's printer dialog will appear, where you can change the settings.      </p>

      <p>
        You can have the printer configuration changes stored between Tux Paint sessions by setting the "<code>printcfg</code>" option.      </p>

      <p>
        If the "<code>printcfg</code>" option is used, printer settings will be loaded from the file "<code>printcfg.cfg</code>" in your personal folder (see below). Any changes will be saved there as well.      </p>

      <p>
        However, this behavior can be changed.

      Loading Other Pictures into Tux Paint    </h1>
  </header>

  <p>
    Tux Paint's 'Open' dialog only displays pictures you created with Tux Paint. So what do you do if you want to load some other drawinng or even a photograph into Tux Paint, so you can edit or draw on it?  </p>

  <p>
    You can simply convert the picture to the format Tux Paint uses &mdash; PNG (Portable Network Graphic) &mdash; and place it in Tux Paint's "<code>saved</code>" directory/folder. Here is where to find it (by default):  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>
      <strong>Windows 10, 8, 7, Vista</strong>
    </dt>

    <dd>
      Inside the user's "<code>AppData</code>" folder, e.g.: "<code>C:\Users\<em>username</em>\AppData\Roaming\TuxPaint\saved\</code>".    </dd>

    <dt>
      <strong>Windows 2000, XP</strong>
    </dt>

    <dd>
      Inside the user's "<code>Application Data</code>" folder, e.g.: "<code>C:\Documents and Settings\<em>username</em>\Application Data\TuxPaint\saved\</code>".    </dd>

    <dt>
      <strong>macOS</strong>
    </dt>

    <dd>
      Inside the user's "<code>Library</code>" folder, e.g.: "<code>/Users/<em>username</em>/Library/Application Support/Tux Paint/saved/</code>".    </dd>

    <dt>
      <strong>Linux/Unix</strong>
    </dt>

    <dd>
      Inside a hidden "<code>.tuxpaint</code>" directory, in the user's home directory ("<code>$HOME</code>"), e.g. "<code>/home/<em>username</em>/.tuxpaint/saved/</code>".    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p class="note">
    <span title="Information">&#128161;</span>    <strong>Note:</strong> It is also from this folder that you can copy or open pictures drawn in Tux Paint using <em>other</em> applications, though the 'Export' option from Tux Paint's 'Open' dialog can be used to copy them to a location that's easier and safer to access.  </p>

  <h2>
    Using the import script, "<code>tuxpaint-import</code>"  </h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Linux and Unix users can use the "<code>tuxpaint-import</code>" shell script which gets installed when you install Tux Paint. It uses some NetPBM tools to convert the image ("<code>anytopnm</code>"), resize it so that it will fit in Tux Paint's canvas ("<code>pnmscale</code>"), and convert it to a PNG ("<code>pnmtopng</code>").    </p>

    <p>
      It also uses the "<code>date</code>" command to get the current time and date, which is the file-naming convention Tux Paint uses for saved files. (Remember, you are never asked for a 'filename' when you go to save or open pictures!)    </p>

    <p>
      To use this script, simply run it from a command-line prompt, and provide it the name(s) of the file(s) you wish to convert.    </p>

    <p>
      They will be converted and placed in your Tux Paint "<code>saved</code>" directory.    </p>
    <p class="note">
      <span title="Information">&#128161;</span>      <strong>Note:</strong> If you're doing this for a different user (e.g., your child) you'll need to make sure to run the command under <em>their</em> account.)    </p>

    <p>
      Example:    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>$ <strong>tuxpaint-import grandma.jpg</strong><br>
      grandma.jpg -&gt;
      /home/username/.tuxpaint/saved/20211231012359.png<br>
      jpegtopnm: WRITING A PPM FILE</code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The first line ("<code>tuxpaint-import grandma.jpg</code>") is the command to run. The following two lines are output from the program while it's working.    </p>

  <h2>
    Importing Pictures Manually  </h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Windows, macOS, and Haiku users who wish to import arbitrary images into Tux Paint must do so via a manual process.    </p>

    <p>
      Load a graphics program that is capable of both loading your picture and saving a PNG format file. (See the documentation file "<a href="PNG.html">PNG.html</a>" for a list of suggested software, and other references.)    </p>

    <p>
      When Tux Paint loads an image that's not the same size as its drawing canvas, it scales (and sometimes smears the edges of) the image so that it fits within the canvas.    </p>

    <p>
      To avoid having the image stretched or smeared, you can resize it to Tux Paint's canvas size. This size depends on the size of the Tux Paint window, or resolution at which Tux Paint is run, if in fullscreen. (<strong>Note:</strong> The default resolution is 800x600.) See "Calculating Image Dimensions", below.    </p>

    <p>
      Save the picture in PNG format. It is <strong>highly</strong> recommended that you name the filename using the current date and time, since that's the convention Tux Paint uses:    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code><strong>YYYYMMDDhhmmss</strong>.png</code>
    </blockquote>

    <ul>
      <li><code>YYYY</code> = Year</li>
      <li><code>MM</code> = Month (two digits, "01"-"12")</li>
      <li><code>DD</code> = Day of month (two digits, "01"-"31")</li>
      <li><code>HH</code> = Hour (two digits, in 24-hour format, "00"-"23")</li>
      <li><code>mm</code> = Minute (two digits, "00"-"59")</li>
      <li><code>ss</code> = Seconds (two digits, "00"-"59")</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Example: "<code>20210731110500.png</code>", for July 31, 2021 at 11:05am.    </p>

    <p>
      Place this PNG file in your Tux Paint "<code>saved</code>" directory/folder. (See above.)    </p>

    <h3>
      Calculating Image Dimensions    </h3>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This part of the documentation needs to be rewritten, since the new "<code>buttonsize</code>" option was added. For now, try drawing and saving an image within Tux Paint, then determine what size (pixel width and height) it came out to, and try to match that when scaling the picture(s) you're importing into Tux Paint.      </p>
