     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                               Tux Paint Config.

     A graphical tool is available that allows you to change Tux Paint's
     behavior. However, if you'd rather not install and use this tool, or
     want a better understanding of the available options, please continue
     reading.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                               Configuration File

     You can create a simple configuration file for Tux Paint, which it will
     read each time you start it up.

     The file is simply a plain text file containing the options you want
     enabled:

Linux and Unix Users

       The file you should create is called ".tuxpaintrc" and it should be
       placed in your home directory. (a.k.a. "~/.tuxpaintrc" or
       "$HOME/.tuxpaintrc")

  System-Wide Configuration File

         Before this file is read, a system-wide configuration file is read.
         (By default, this configuration has no settings enabled.) It is
         located at:

           /etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.conf

         You can disable reading of this file altogether, leaving the
         settings as defaults (which can then be overridden by your
         ".tuxpaintrc" file and/or command-line arguments) by using the
         command-line option:

           --nosysconfig

macOS Users

       The file you should create is called "tuxpaint.cfg" and it should be
       placed in your home folder, under the sub-folder: Library/Application
       Support/TuxPaint

  System-Wide Configuration File

         Before this file is read, a system-wide configuration file is read.
         (By default, this configuration has no settings enabled.) It is
         located at:

           /Library/Application Support/TuxPaint/tuxpaint.cfg

Windows Users

       The file you should create is called "tuxpaint.cfg" and it should be
       placed in Tux Paint's folder.

       You can use NotePad or WordPad to create this file. Be sure to save it
       as Plain Text, and make sure the filename doesn't have ".txt" at the
       end...

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                               Available Options

     The following settings can be set in the configuration file.
     (Command-line settings will override these. See the "Command-Line
     Options" section, below.)

     fullscreen=yes

             Run the program in full screen mode, rather than in a window.

     fullscreen=native

             Run the program in full screen mode. Additionally, assume the
             screen's current resolution (set by the operating system).

     windowsize=SIZE

             Run the program at a different size (in windowed mode) or at a
             different screen resolution (in fullscreen mode), rather than
             the default (usually 800x600).

             The SIZE value should be presented in pixels, in
             'width-by-height' format, with an "x" (lowercase X) between the
             values. The size can be anything that's at least 640 wide, and
             at least 480 tall.

             Some examples:

                * 640x480
                * 1024x768
                * 768x1024
                * 1600x1200

     orient=portrait

             Swaps the width/height options given to Tux Paint, useful for
             rotating the window on portait displays, such as a tablet PC
             that's in tablet orientation.

     native=yes

             When running Tux Paint in fullscreen mode, this assumes the
             screen's current resolution (overriding any "windowsize"
             option), as set by the operating system.

     buttonsize=SIZE

             Set the pixel size of buttons in Tux Paint's user interface
             (overriding the default of "48"). Useful when using very
             high-density displays or coarse input devices, such as eye gaze
             trackers.

             The SIZE value should be presented in pixels, and can be
             anything between 24 and 192, inclusive. Most buttons are square,
             and this will affect their width and height.

             Note: If the chosen button size would cause the buttons to be
             too large for all required UI elements to appear under Tux
             Paint's chosen window size, the largest possible button size
             will be used. (A note will appear in stderr.)

     allowscreensaver=yes

             By default, Tux Paint prevents your system's screensaver from
             starting up. You can override this by using the
             "allowscreensaver" option. Note: This requires version 1.2.12 or
             higher of the SDL library. (You can also do this by setting the
             "SDL_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER" environment variable on your
             system to "1".)

     nosound=yes

             Disable sound effects. (Note: Pressing [Alt] + [S] cannot be
             used to reenable sounds if they were disabled using this
             option.)

     nostereo=yes

             Disable stereo panning support. (Useful for users with hearing
             impairment in one ear, or places where a single speaker or
             headphone is being used.)

     noquit=yes

             Disable the on-screen "Quit" button and prevent the [Escape] key
             from quitting Tux Paint.

             Using the [Alt] + [F4] keyboard combination or clicking the
             window's close button (assuming you're not in fullscreen mode)
             still works to quit Tux Paint.

             You can also use the following keyboard combination to quit:
             [Shift] + [Control] + [Escape].

     noprint=yes

             Disable the printing feature.

     printdelay=SECONDS

             Restrict printing so that printing can occur only once every
             SECONDS seconds.

     printcommand=COMMAND

             (Linux and Unix only)

             Use the command COMMAND to print a PostScript format file when
             the 'Print' button is clicked. If this option is not
             specifically not set, the default command is:

               lpr

             Note: Versions of Tux Paint prior to 0.9.15 sent PNG format data
             to the print command (which defaulted to "pngtopnm | pnmtops |
             lpr").

             If you set an alternative printcommand in the configuration file
             prior to version 0.9.15, you will need to change it.

     altprintcommand=COMMAND

             (Linux and Unix only)

             Use the command COMMAND to print a PostScript format file when
             the 'Print' button is clicked while the [Alt] modifier key is
             being held. (This is typically used for providing a print
             dialog, similar to when pressing [Alt]+'Print' in Windows and
             macOS.)

             If this option is not specifically not set, the default command
             is KDE's graphical print dialog:

               kprinter

     printcfg=yes

             (Windows and macOS only)

             Tux Paint will use a printer configuration file when printing.
             Push the [Alt] key while clicking the 'Print' button in Tux
             Paint to cause a Windows print dialog window to appear.

             (Note: This only works when not running Tux Paint in fullscreen
             mode.) Any configuration changes made in this dialog will be
             saved to the file "userdata/print.cfg" , and used again, as long
             as the "printcfg" option is set.

     altprint=always

             This causes Tux Paint to always show the printer dialog (or, on
             Linux/Unix, run the "altprintcommand") when the 'Print' button
             is clicked. In other words, it's like clicking 'Print' while
             holding [Alt], except you don't need to hold [Alt] every time.

     altprint=never

             This prevents Tux Paint from ever showing the printer dialog
             (or, on Linux/Unix, run the "altprintcommand") when the 'Print'
             button is clicked. In other words, it makes the [Alt] key have
             no effect when clicking the 'Print' button.

     altprint=mod

             This is the normal, default behavior. Tux Paint shows a printer
             dialog (or, on Linux/Unix, runs the "altprintcommand"), when the
             [Alt] key is pressed while the 'Print' button is clicked.
             Clicking 'Print' without holding [Alt] prints without showing a
             dialog.

     papersize=PAPERSIZE

             (Platforms that use Tux Paint's internal PostScript generator —
             not Windows, macOS, BeOS, or Haiku.)

             Tell Tux Paint what size PostScript to generate. If none is
             specified, Tux Paint first checks your $PAPER environment
             variable, then the file /etc/papersize, then uses the the
             'libpaper' library's default paper size.

             Valid paper sizes include: letter, legal, tabloid, executive,
             note, statement, a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10,
             b0, b1, b2 b3, b4, 10x14, 11x17, halfletter, halfexecutive,
             halfnote, folio, quarto, ledger, archA, archB, archC, archD,
             archE, flsa, flse, csheet, dsheet, esheet.

     nolockfile=yes

             By default, Tux Paint uses what's known as a 'lockfile' to
             prevent it from being launched more than once in 30 seconds.
             (This is to avoid accidentally running multiple copies; for
             example, by double-clicking a single-click launcher, or simply
             impatiently clicking the icon multiple times.)

             To make Tux Paint ignore the lockfile, allowing it to run again,
             even if it was just launched less than 30 seconds ago, enable
             this setting in the configuration file, or run Tux Paint with
             the --nolockfile option on the command-line.

             By default, the lockfile is stored in "~/.tuxpaint/" under Linux
             and Unix, and "userdata\" under Windows.

     simpleshapes=yes

             Disable the rotation step of the 'Shape' tool. Click, drag and
             release is all that will be needed to draw a shape.

     uppercase=yes

             All text will be rendered only in uppercase (e.g., "Brush" will
             be "BRUSH"). Useful for children who can read, but who have only
             learned uppercase letters so far.

     grab=yes

             Tux Paint will attempt to 'grab' the mouse and keyboard, so that
             the mouse is confined to Tux Paint's window, and nearly all
             keyboard input is passed directly to it.

             This is useful to disable operating system actions that could
             get the user out of Tux Paint [Alt]-[Tab] window cycling,
             [Ctrl]-[Escape], etc. This is especially useful in fullscreen
             mode.

     noshortcuts=yes

             This disable keyboard shortcuts (e.g., [Ctrl]-[S] for save,
             [Ctrl]-[N] for a new image, etc.)

             This is useful to prevent unwanted commands from being activated
             by children who aren't experienced with keyboards.

     nowheelmouse=yes

             This disables support for the wheel on mice that have it.
             (Normally, the wheel will scroll the selector menu on the
             right.)

     nobuttondistinction=yes

             Prior to Tux Paint 0.9.15, the middle and right buttons on a
             mouse could also be used for clicking. In version 0.9.15, it was
             changed so that only the left mouse button worked, so as to not
             train children to use the wrong button.

             However, for children who have trouble with the mouse, this
             distinction between the two or three buttons on a mouse can be
             disabled (returning Tux Paint to its old behavior) by using this
             option.

     nofancycursors=yes

             This disables the fancy mouse pointer shapes in Tux Paint, and
             uses your environment's normal mouse pointer.

             In some enviornments, the fancy cursors cause problems. Use this
             option to avoid them.

     hidecursor=yes

             This completely hides the mouse pointer shapes in Tux Paint.

             This is useful for touchscreen devices, such as tablet PCs.

     nooutlines=yes

             In this mode, much simpler outlines and 'rubber-band' lines are
             displayed when using the Lines, Shapes, Stamps and Eraser tools.

             This can help when Tux Paint is run on very slow computers, or
             displayed on a remote X-Window display.

     sysfonts=yes

             This option causes Tux Paint to attempt to load fonts (for use
             in the Text tool) from your operating system. Normally, Tux
             Paint will only load the ones that came bundled with Tux Paint.

     alllocalefonts=yes

             Prior to version 0.9.21, Tux Paint loaded all fonts in its own
             fonts directory, including locale-specific ones (e.g., the one
             for Tibetan, which had no latin characters). As of 0.9.21, the
             only font loaded from the locale-specific subdirectory, if any,
             is one matching the locale Tux Paint is running on.

             To load all locale-specific fonts (the old behavior), set this
             option.

     nostamps=yes

             This option tells Tux Paint to not load any rubber stamp images,
             which in turn ends up disabling the Stamps tool.

             This can speed up Tux Paint when it first loads up, and reduce
             memory usage while it's running. Of course, no stamps will be
             available at all.

     nostampcontrols=yes

             Some images in the Stamps tool can be mirrored, flipped, and/or
             have their size changed. This option disables the controls, and
             only provides the basic stamps.

     nomagiccontrols=yes

             Some Magic tools have the option of acting like a paintbrush, or
             affecting the entire canvas at once. This option disables the
             controls, and only provides the default functionality (usually
             paint-mode).

     noshapecontrols=yes

             Disable the control buttons shown when using the Shapes tool
             that allow changing how shapes are drawn — centered around the
             initial mouse click, or with a corner at the initial mouse
             click.

     nolabel=yes

             Disables the Label tool: the tool that allows text entry which
             can be edited later.

     newcolorslast=yes

             Places the blank color options in the New dialog at the end, so
             that any Starters and/or Templates are shown first.

     mirrorstamps=yes

             For stamps that can be mirrored, this option sets them to their
             mirrored shape by default.

             This can be useful for people who prefer things right-to-left,
             rather than left-to-right.

     mouse-accessibility=yes

             In this mode, instead of clicking, dragging and releasing (e.g.,
             to draw), you click, move, and click again to end the motion.

     onscreen-keyboard=yes

             Presents a clickable on-screen keyboard when using the Text and
             Label tools.

     onscreen-keyboard-layout=LAYOUTNAME

             Selects the initial layout for the on-screen keyboard when using
             the Text and Label tools.
             Note: Using this option implies automatically
             onscreen-keyboard=yes, so setting both is redundant.

     onscreen-keyboard-disable-change=yes

             Disables the possibility for changing the layout of the
             on-screen keyboard when using the Text and Label tools, useful
             for simplifying things for the small children.
             Note: Using this option implies automatically
             onscreen-keyboard=yes, so setting both is redundant.

     joystick-dev=N

             Specify which joystick device should be used by Tux Paint.
             Default value is 0 (the first joystick).

     joystick-slowness=SPEED

             Sets a delay at each axis motion, allowing to slow the joystick.
             Allowed values are from 0 to 500. Default value is 15.

     joystick-threshold=THRESHOLD

             Sets the minimum level of axis motion to start moving the
             pointer. Allowed values are from 0 to 32766. Default value is
             3200.

     joystick-maxsteps=STEPS

             Sets the maximum pixels the pointer will move at once. Allowed
             values are from 1 to 7. Default value is 7.

     joystick-hat-timeout=MILLISECONDS

             Sets the delay after wich the pointer will start moving
             automatically if the hat is keeped pushed. Allowed values are
             from 0 to 3000. Default value is 1000.

     joystick-hat-slowness=SPEED

             Sets a delay at each automatic motion, allowing to slow the
             speed of the hat. Allowed values are from 0 to 500. Default
             value is 15.

     joystick-btn-escape=BUTTON NUMBER

             Selects the joystick button number, as seen by SDL, that will be
             used to generate a escape event. Useful to dismiss dialogs and
             quit.

     joystick-btn-brush=BUTTON NUMBER

             Selects the joystick button number, as seen by SDL, that will be
             a shortcut to select the brush tool.

     joystick-btn-stamp=BUTTON NUMBER

             Selects the joystick button number, as seen by SDL, that will be
             a shortcut to select the stamp tool.

     joystick-btn-lines=BUTTON NUMBER

             Selects the joystick button number, as seen by SDL, that will be
             a shortcut to select the lines tool.

     joystick-btn-shapes=BUTTON NUMBER

             Selects the joystick button number, as seen by SDL, that will be
             a shortcut to select the shapes tool.

     joystick-btn-text=BUTTON NUMBER

             Selects the joystick button number, as seen by SDL, that will be
             a shortcut to select the text tool.

     joystick-btn-label=BUTTON NUMBER

             Selects the joystick button number, as seen by SDL, that will be
             a shortcut to select the label tool.

     joystick-btn-magic=BUTTON NUMBER

             Selects the joystick button number, as seen by SDL, that will be
             a shortcut to select the magic tool.

     joystick-btn-undo=BUTTON NUMBER

             Selects the joystick button number, as seen by SDL, that will be
             a shortcut to invoke the undo tool.

     joystick-btn-redo=BUTTON NUMBER

             Selects the joystick button number, as seen by SDL, that will be
             a shortcut to select redo tool.

     joystick-btn-eraser=BUTTON NUMBER

             Selects the joystick button number, as seen by SDL, that will be
             a shortcut to select eraser tool.

     joystick-btn-new=BUTTON NUMBER

             Selects the joystick button number, as seen by SDL, that will be
             a shortcut to launch the dialog for creating a new drawing.

     joystick-btn-open=BUTTON NUMBER

             Selects the joystick button number, as seen by SDL, that will be
             a shortcut to launch the dialog for opening an existing drawing.

     joystick-btn-save=BUTTON NUMBER

             Selects the joystick button number, as seen by SDL, that will be
             a shortcut to save the drawing.

     joystick-btn-pgsetup=BUTTON NUMBER

             Selects the joystick button number, as seen by SDL, that will be
             a shortcut to launch the page setup dialog for printing.

     joystick-btn-print=BUTTON NUMBER

             Selects the joystick button number, as seen by SDL, that will be
             a shortcut to print.

     joystick-buttons-ignore=BUTTON1,BUTTON2,...

             A set of joystick button numbers, as seen by SDL, that should be
             ignored. Otherwise, unless they are used by one of the
             "joystick-btn-" options above, buttons will be seen as a mouse
             left-click.

     stampsize=SIZE

             Use this option to force Tux Paint to set the starting size of
             all stamps. The SIZE value should be between 0 (smallest) and 10
             (largest). The size is relative to the available sizes of the
             stamp, which depends on the stamp itself, and Tux Paint's
             current canvas size.

             Specify "default" to let Tux Paint decide (its standard
             behavior).

     keyboard=yes

             This allows the keyboard arrow keys to be used to control the
             mouse pointer. (e.g., for mouseless environments, or
             handicapped/accessibility purposes)

             Features:

                * Fine movement within canvas, or coarse movement if Shift is
                  held.
                * Coarse movement within tool button areas.
                * Key controls:
                     * [Left]/[Right]/[Up]/[Down], numpad [1] thru [9]: Move
                       mouse
                     * [Space]/[5]: Click mouse (except when using "Text" or
                       "Label" tools)
                     * [Insert]/[F5]: Click mouse (always)
                     * [F4] jump mouse between "Tools", "Colors" and canvas
                       areas
                     * If mouse is within "Tools" section on the left, or
                       "Colors" section at the bottom:
                          * [F7], [F8]: Move down/up between buttons,
                            respectively (Tools section, only)
                          * [F11], [F12]: Move to previous/next button,
                            respectively
                * To click-and-drag, hold one of the 'click' keys (e.g.,
                  [Insert]), and use the movement keys (e.g., [Left]).
                     * Note: The "mouse accessibility" feature works with the
                       keyboard mouse controls. With both options enabled,
                       painting tools can be used to draw by pressing a
                       'click' key to start clicking, movement keys to move
                       around (which will draw), and another 'click' key to
                       end the click (stop drawing).
                * A regular mouse and/or joystick may still be used (so you
                  can, e.g., move with the mouse, and click with the
                  keyboard, or vice-versa)

     savedir=DIRECTORY

             Use this option to change where Tux Paint's "saved"
             directory/folder is located, which is where Tux Paint saves and
             opens pictures.

             If you do not override it, the default location is:

                * Linux & Unix — Under a hidden directory named ".tuxpaint"
                  in your home directory (aka "~" or "$HOME")
                  Example: /home/username/.tuxpaint/saved/
                * Windows — Inside a folder named "TuxPaint" in your
                  "Application Data" folder.
                  Example: C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Application
                  Data\TuxPaint\saved\
                * macOS — Inside a folder named "TuxPaint" in your
                  "Application Support" folder.
                  Example: /Users/Username/Library/Application
                  Support/TuxPaint/saved/

             Note: When specifying a Windows drive (e.g., "H:\"), you must
             also specify a subdirectory.

             Note: Prior to version 0.9.18, Tux Paint would also use the
             setting or default for "savedir" as the place to search for
             personal data files (brushes, stamps, starters and fonts). As of
             version 0.9.18, they may be specified separately (see the
             "datadir" option, below).

             Example: savedir=Z:\tuxpaint\

     exportdir=DIRECTORY

             Use this option to change where Tux Paint exports files — single
             images, or animated GIF slideshows — for external use.

             If you do not override it, the default location is:

                * Linux & Unix — If available, wherever your desktop
                  environment is configured for pictures to be stored, based
                  on your XDG (X Desktop Group) configuration. (Try running
                  the command-line "xdg-user-dir PICTURES" to find out.)
                  Typically (in an English locale), this will be a "Pictures"
                  subdirectory in your home directory (i.e., "$HOME/Pictures"
                  aka "~/Pictures").
                  Tux Paint will fall back to using that typical directory,
                  of no XDG configuration can be read, or nothing is set for
                  "XDG_PICTURES_DIR".
                * Windows - "My Pictures" directory for each user (normaly
                  "c:\Users\USERNAME\Pictures").
                  You can directly open the folder as follows:
                     * Press "[Windows]+[R]" key to open "Run ..." dialogue.
                     * Enter "Shell:My Pictures" in the text box and push
                       [OK].
                * macOS — TBD!

             Note: When the defaults are used, a new "TuxPaint" subdirectory
             will be created and used. (e.g., "~/Pictures/TuxPaint") When the
             "--exportdir" option is used, the exact path specified will be
             used (no "TuxPaint" subdirectory is created).

             The directory itself (e.g., "~/Pictures/TuxPaint") will be
             created, if it doesn't exist.

             If the parent directory (e.g., "~/Pictures/TuxPaint") also does
             not exist, Tux Paint will attempt to create it as well (but not
             any directories higher than that).

             Example: exportdir=/home/penguin/TuxPaintExports

     datadir=DIRECTORY

             Use this option to change where Tux Paint looks for personal
             data files (brushes, stamps, starters, templates, and fonts
             specific to the current user).

             Tux Paint will search for subdirectories/subfolders named
             "brushes", "stamps", "starters", "templates", and "fonts" under
             the specified data directory.

             If you do not override it, the default location is:

                * Linux & Unix — Under a hidden directory named ".tuxpaint"
                  in your home directory (aka "~" or "$HOME")
                  Example: /home/username/.tuxpaint/brushes/
                * Windows — Inside a folder named "TuxPaint" in your
                  "Application Data" folder.
                  Example: C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Application
                  Data\TuxPaint\brushes\
                * macOS — Inside a folder named "TuxPaint" in your
                  "Application Support" folder.
                  Example: /Users/Username/Library/Application
                  Support/TuxPaint/brushes/

             Note: Prior to version 0.9.18, Tux Paint would use the same
             setting or default as for "savedir" to search for data files. As
             of version 0.9.18, they may be specified separately.

             Note: When specifying a Windows drive (e.g., "H:\"), you must
             also specify a subdirectory.

             Example: datadir=/home/johnny/tuxpaint-data/

     saveover=yes

             This disables the "Save over the old version...?" prompt when
             saving an existing file. With this option, the older version
             will always be replaced by the new version, automatically.

     saveover=new

             This also disables the "Save over the old version...?" prompt
             when saving an existing file. This option, however, will always
             save a new file, rather than overwrite the older version.

     saveover=ask

             (This option is redundant, since this is the default.) When
             saving an existing drawing, you will be first asked whether to
             save over the older version or not.

     nosave=yes

             This disables Tux Paint's ability to save files (and therefore
             disables the on-screen "Save" button). It can be used in
             situations where the program is only being used for fun, or in a
             test environment.

     autosave=yes

             This prevents Tux Paint from asking whether you want to save the
             current picture when quitting, and assumes you do.

     startblank=yes

             This causes Tux Paint to display a blank canvas when it first
             starts up, rather than loading the last image that was being
             edited.

     colorfile=FILENAME

             You may override Tux Paint's default color palette by creating a
             plain ASCII text file that describes the colors you want, and
             pointing to that file using the "colorfile" option.

             The file should list one color per line. Colors are defined in
             terms of their Red, Green and Blue values, each from 0 (off) to
             255 (brightest). (For more information, try Wikipedia's "RGB
             color model" article.)

             Colors may be listed using three decimal numbers (e.g., "255 68
             136") or a 6- or 3-digit-long hexadecimal 'triplet' (e.g.,
             "#ff4488" or "#F48").

             After the color definition (on the same line) you may enter text
             to describe the color. Tux will display this text when the color
             is clicked. (For example, "#FFF White as snow.")

             As an example, you can see the default colors currently used in
             Tux Paint in: "default_colors.txt".

             NOTES: You must separate decimal values with spaces, and begin
             hexadecimal values with a pound/number-sign character ("#"). In
             3-digit hexadecimal, each digit is used for both the high and
             low halves of the byte, so "#FFF" is the same as "#FFFFFF", not
             "#F0F0F0".

     colorsrows=ROWS

             How many rows of color palette buttons to show; useful when
             using a large color palette (see "colorfile", above), and/or for
             use with coarse input devices (like eyegaze trackers). "ROWS"
             may be between "1" (the default) and "3".

     lang=LANGUAGE

             Run Tux Paint in one of the supported languages. Possible choice
             for LANGUAGE currently include:

                       Overriding System Config. Options

     (For Linux and Unix users)

     If any of the above options are set in "/etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.config",
     you can override them in your own "~/.tuxpaintrc" file.

     For true/false options, like "noprint" and "grab", you can simply say
     they equal 'no' in your "~/.tuxpaintrc" file:

       noprint=no
       uppercase=no

     Or, you can use options similar to the command-line override options
     described below. For example:

       print=yes
       mixedcase=yes

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                              Command-Line Options

     Options can also be issued on the command-line when you start Tux Paint.

       --mouse
       --saveoverask
       --save
       --noautosave

               These options can be used to override any settings made in the
               configuration file. (If the option isn't set in the
               configuration file(s), no overriding option is necessary.)

                     -------------------------------------

       --locale LOCALE

               Run Tux Paint in one of the support languages. See the
               "Choosing a Different Language" section below for the locale
               strings (e.g., "de_DE" for German) to use.

               (If your locale is already set, e.g. with the "$LANG"
               environment variable, this option is not necessary, since Tux
               Paint honors your environment's setting, if possible.)

       --nosysconfig

               Under Linux and Unix, this prevents the system-wide
               configuration file, "/etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.conf", from being
               read.

               Only your own configuration file, "~/.tuxpaintrc", if it
               exists, will be used.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Command-Line Informational Options

       The following options display some informative text on the screen. Tux
       Paint doesn't actually start up and run afterwards, however.

         --version
         --verbose-version

                 Display the version number and date of the copy of Tux Paint
                 you are running. The "--verbose-version" also lists what
                 compile-time options were set. (See INSTALL and FAQ).

         --copying

                 Show brief license information about copying Tux Paint.

         --usage

                 Display the list of available command-line options.

         --help

                 Display brief help on using Tux Paint.

         --lang help

                 Display a list of available languages in Tux Paint.

         --joystick-dev list

                 Display list of attached joysticks available to Tux Paint.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                         Choosing a Different Language

     Tux Paint has been translated into a number of languages. To access the
     translations, you can use the "--lang" option on the command-line to set
     the language (e.g. "--lang spanish") or use the "lang=" setting in the
     configuration file (e.g., "lang=spanish").

     Tux Paint also honors your environment's current locale. (You can
     override it on the command-line using the "--locale" option; see above.)

     Use the option "--lang help" to list the available language options
     available.

       (*) - These languages require their own fonts, since they are not
       represented using a Latin character set, like the others. See the
       "Special Fonts" section, below.

       Note: Tux Paint provides an alternative input method for entering
       characters with the Text tool in some locales. The key comibation(s)
       listed can be used to cycle through the supported input methods while
       the Text tool is active.

Setting Your Environment's Locale

       Changing your locale will affect much of your environment.

       As stated above, along with letting you choose the language at runtime
       using command-line options ("--lang" and "--locale"), Tux Paint honors
       the global locale setting in your environment.

       If you haven't already set your environment's locale, the following
       will briefly explain how:

  Linux/Unix Users

         First, be sure the locale you want to use is enabled by editing the
         file "/etc/locale.gen" on your system and then running the program
         "locale-gen" as root.

         Note: Debian users may be able to simply run the command
         "dpkg-reconfigure locales" as root to bring up a configuration
         dialog. Ubuntu users may be able to run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure
         localeconf" (the "localeconf" package may need to be installed
         first), or you may need to edit the file
         "/var/lib/locales/supported.d/local" first, and add locales they
         want, from the list found in "/usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED".

         Then, before running Tux Paint, set your "$LANG" environment
         variable to one of the locales listed above. (If you want all
         programs that can be translated to be, you may wish to place the
         following in your login script; e.g. "~/.profile", "~/.bashrc",
         "~/.cshrc", etc.)

         For example, in a Bourne Shell (like BASH):

           export LANG=es_ES ; \
           tuxpaint

         And in a C Shell (like TCSH):

           setenv LANG es_ES ; \
           tuxpaint

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Windows Users

         Tux Paint will recognize the current locale and use the appropriate
         files by default. So this section is only for people trying
         different languages.

         The simplest thing to do is to use the "--lang" switch in the
         shortcut (see "INSTALL"). However, by using an MSDOS Prompt window,
         it is also possible to issue a command like this:

           set LANG=es_ES

         ...which will set the language for the lifetime of that DOS window.

         For something more permanent, you can set an 'environment variable'
         using the "System properties" dialogue as follows:

           * Press the "[Windows]+[R]" key combination to open the "Run ..."
             dialogue.
           * Enter "sysdm.cpl" in the text box and click the "[OK]" button to
             open the "System properties" dialogue.
           * Select the "Advanced" tab.
           * Click the "Environment Variables..." button.
           * Edit the value of the parameter "LANG" (create it, if it doesn't
             exists).

  Special Fonts

       Some languages require special fonts be installed. These font files
       (which are in TrueType format (TTF)), are much too large to include
       with the Tux Paint download, and are available separately. (See the
       table above, under the "Choosing a Different Language" section.)

       Note: As of version 0.9.18, Tux Paint uses the "SDL_Pango" library,
       which utilizes the "Pango" library to render text in the user
       interface, rather than using "SDL_ttf" directly. Unless your copy of
       Tux Paint was built without Pango support, special fonts should no
       longer be necessary.

       When running Tux Paint in a language that requires its own font, Tux
       Paint will try to load the font file from its system-wide "fonts"
       directory (under a "locale" subdirectory). The name of the file
       corresponds to the first two letters in the 'locale' code of the
       language (e.g., "ko" for Korean, "ja" for Japanese, "zh_tw" for
       Traditional Chinese).

       For example, under Linux or Unix, when Tux Paint is run in Korean
       (e.g., with the option "--lang korean"), Tux Paint will attempt to
       load the following font file:

         /usr/share/tuxpaint/fonts/locale/ko.ttf

       You can download fonts for supported languages from Tux Paint's
       website, http://www.tuxpaint.org/. (Look in the 'Fonts' section under
       'Download.')

       Under Unix and Linux, you can use the Makefile that comes with the
       font to install the font in the appropriate location.
