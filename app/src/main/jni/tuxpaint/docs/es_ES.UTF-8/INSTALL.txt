                                  Requirements

Simple DirectMedia Layer library (libSDL)

   Tux Paint requires the Simple DirectMedia Layer Library (libSDL), an Open
   Source multimedia programming library available under the GNU Lesser
   General Public License (LGPL).

   Along with libSDL, Tux Paint depends on a number of other SDL 'helper'
   libraries: SDL_Image (for graphics files), SDL_gfx (for some graphical
   functions, like rotation), SDL_TTF and (optionally) SDL2_Pango (for True
   Type Font support) and, optionally, SDL_Mixer (for sound effects).

   The SDL libraries are available as source-code, or as RPM or Debian
   packages for various distributions of Linux. They can be downloaded from:

     * libSDL: http://www.libsdl.org/
     * SDL_image: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image
     * SDL_gfx:
       https://www.ferzkopp.net/wordpress/2016/01/02/sdl_gfx-sdl2_gfx/
       (https://sourceforge.net/projects/sdlgfx/)
     * SDL_ttf: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf
     * SDL2_Pango: https://github.com/markuskimius/SDL2_Pango (optional)
     * SDL_mixer: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer (optional)

   They are also typically available along with your Linux distribution (e.g.
   on an installation media, or available via package maintainance software
   like Debian's "apt").

   💡 Note: When installing libraries from packages, be sure to ALSO install
   the development versions of the packages. (For example, install both
   "SDL2-2.24.0.rpm" and "SDL2-devel-2.24.0.rpm".)

  Other Libraries

   Tux Paint also takes advantage of a number of other free, LGPL'd
   libraries. Under Linux, just like SDL, they should either already be
   installed, or are readily available for installation as part of your Linux
   distribution.

   libPNG

           Tux Paint uses PNG (Portable Network Graphics) format for its data
           files. SDL_image will require libPNG be installed.

           http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html

   gettext

           Tux Paint uses your system's locale settings along with the
           "gettext" library to support various languages (e.g., Spanish).
           You'll need the gettext library installed.

           http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/

   libpaper (Linux/Unix only)

           As of Tux Paint 0.9.17, Tux Paint can determine your system's
           default paper size (e.g., A4 or Letter), or can be told to use a
           particular paper size, thanks to "libpaper".

           https://github.com/naota/libpaper

   FriBiDi

           Tux Paint's "Text" and also "Label" tools support bidirectional
           languages, thanks to the "FriBiDi" library.

           http://fribidi.org/

   SVG graphics support

           As of Tux Paint 0.9.17, Tux Paint can load SVG (Scalable Vector
           Graphics) images as stamps. Two sets of libraries are supported,
           and SVG support can be completely disabled (via "make SVG_LIB:=")

                librsvg-2 & libCairo2 (newer libraries)
                           * libRSVG 2: http://librsvg.sourceforge.net/
                           * Cairo 2: http://www.cairographics.org/
                           * These also depend on the following:
                                * GdkPixbuf & GLib: http://www.gtk.org/
                                * Pango: http://www.pango.org/

                Older SVG libraries
                           * libcairo1, libsvg1, & libsvg-cairo1:
                             http://www.cairographics.org/
                           * These also depend on the following:
                                * libxml2:
                                  https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2

   Animated GIF Export feature

           To support export of animated GIFs (slideshows), the
           "libimagequant" library (from the "pngquant2" project) is
           required.

           https://github.com/ImageOptim/libimagequant

   NetPBM Tools (optional) No longer used, by default

           📜 Under Linux and Unix, earlier versions of Tux Paint used the
           NetPBM tools to assist with printing. (A PNG is generated by Tux
           Paint, and converted into a PostScript using the 'pngtopnm' and
           'pnmtops' NetPBM command-line tools.)

           http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/

                           Compiling and Installation

   Tux Paint is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) (see
   "COPYING.txt" for details), and therefore the 'source code' to the program
   is available freely.

  Compiling Set-Up

   As of February 2005 (starting with Tux Paint 0.9.15), the "Makefile"
   includes support for building on a Windows system using MinGW/MSYS
   (https://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/).

   Many tools and libraries are required to build Tux Paint. The package
   management system "pacman" helps you install them automatically solving
   complicated dependencies.

    MYSYS2

   Download the latest MSYS2 environment from https://www.msys2.org/ and
   install it where you'd like (the default is "C:\msys64")

   Open the MSYS2 shell from the "Start Menu" -> "MSYS2 64bit" -> "MSYS2
   MSYS" and execute following command:

     $ yes "" | pacman -Syu

   This will update core system and the window will close automatically. Open
   the msys2 shell again and execute following command to finish remaining
   updating process.

     $ yes "" | pacman -Syu

   Within the MSYS2 shell, run the following command to install basic
   development tools:

     $ yes "" | pacman -S make automake-wrapper autoconf-wrapper libtool git
     zip patch gperf dos2unix

   Proceed to the next "MinGW 64bit (x86_64) toolchains" section, or skip to
   the "MinGW 32bit (i686) toolchains" section if you need only a 32bit build
   environment.

            -------------------------------------------------------

    MinGW 64bit (x86_64) compiler and tools

   Within the MSYS2 shell, run the following command to install 64bit
   compiler and basic development tools:

     $ yes "" | pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-{gcc,pkgconf,ntldd-git}

   "ntldd" is a small tool which examine windows executable files to list
   Dynamic Link Library (.dll) files they depends on. Tux Paint's packaging
   process for binary distribution uses it to find required .dll files.

    64bit (x86_64) dependency libraries for Tux Paint and Tux Paint Config

   You can install tools and libraries required for compiling Tux Paint and
   Tux Paint Config on MSYS2/MINGW using "pacman" except for SDL2_Pango and
   libunibreak.

   FLTK is a cross-platform GUI toolkit used by "Tux Paint Config". You can
   skip installing it if you are only building "Tux Paint".

     $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL_{image,ttf,gfx}
     $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-{librsvg,fribidi,libimagequant,fltk}

   💡 Note: Close the shell before proceeding to the remaining process.

    Install SDL2_Pango and libunibreak on the 64bit environment

   SDL2_Pango and libunibreak should be installed manually.

   This time, use the MinGW "64bit" shell. Open the shell from the "Start
   Menu" -> "MSYS2 64bit" -> "MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit"

      SDL2_Pango

   You can fetch the source code from the Mark K. Kim's git repositry,
   compile and install it as follows.

     $ git clone https://github.com/markuskimius/SDL2_Pango
     $ cd SDL2_Pango
     $ ./configure --prefix=/mingw64 && make && make install

      libunibreak

   libunibreak is required for compiling Tux Paint Config. You can skip
   installing it if you are only building "Tux Paint".

   You can fetch the source code from the git repositry and compile it as
   follows.

     $ git clone https://github.com/adah1972/libunibreak libunibreak
     $ cd libunibreak
     $ ./augogen.sh --prefix=/mingw64 && make && make install

   Proceed to the next "MinGW 32bit (i686) toolchains" section, or skip to
   the "ImageMagick" section if you need only a 64bit build environment.

            -------------------------------------------------------

    MinGW 32bit (i686) compiler and tools

   Within the MSYS2 shell, run the following command to install 32bit
   compiler and basic development tools:

     $ yes "" | pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-{gcc,pkgconf,ntldd-git}

   "ntldd" is a small tool which examine windows executable files to list
   Dynamic Link Library (.dll) files they depends on. Tux Paint's packaging
   process for binary distribution uses it to find required .dll files.

    32bit (i686) dependency libraries for Tux Paint and Tux Paint Config

   You can install tools and libraries required for compiling Tux Paint and
   Tux Paint Config on MSYS2/MINGW using "pacman" except for SDL2_Pango and
   libunibreak.

   FLTK is a cross-platform GUI toolkit used by "Tux Paint Config". You can
   skip installing it if you are only building "Tux Paint".

     $ pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-SDL_{image,ttf,gfx}
     $ pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-{librsvg,fribidi,libimagequant,fltk}

   💡 Note: Close the shell before proceeding to the remaining process.

    Install SDL2_Pango and libunibreak on the 32bit environment

   SDL2_Pango and libunibreak should be installed manually.

   This time, use the MinGW "32bit" shell. Open the shell from the "Start
   Menu" -> "MSYS2 64bit" -> "MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit"

      SDL2_Pango

   You can fetch the source code from the Mark K. Kim's git repositry,
   compile and install it as follows.

     $ git clone https://github.com/markuskimius/SDL2_Pango
     $ cd SDL2_Pango
     $ ./configure --prefix=/mingw32 && make && make install

      libunibreak

   libunibreak is required for compiling Tux Paint Config. You can skip
   installing it if you are only building "Tux Paint".

   You can fetch the source code from the git repositry and compile it as
   follows.

     $ git clone https://github.com/adah1972/libunibreak libunibreak
     $ cd libunibreak
     $ ./augogen.sh --prefix=/mingw32 && make && make install

  ImageMagick

   ImageMagick is a compilation of command line tools to create, edit,
   compose, or convert bitmap images supporting quite a large number of image
   formats. Tux Paint uses two functions ("convert" and "composite") in it to
   generate thumbnails for startar images and templates during the build
   process.

   Using official binary release available from "Windows Binary Release" is
   recommended, due to the commands installed with "pacman" on MinGW/MSYS not
   working as expected!

   Do not forget to enable "Install legacy utilities (e.g. convert)" while
   installing it, because Tux Paint's build process uses them.

   Add the path to the directory in which ImageMagick is installed at the top
   of your "PATH" environment variable. For example:

     $ export PATH=/c/Program\ Files/ImageMagick-7.0.10-Q16-HDRI:$PATH

   You can make this permanent by adding the above to your the BASH shell
   configuration file, "~/.bash_profile".

  Tux Paint & Tux Paint Config.

   You can compile 64-bit binaries using "MSYS2 64bit" shell, and 32-bit
   binaries using "MSYS2 32bit" shell, respectively.

     * Select "MSYS2 64bit" -> "MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit" from the "Start Menu" to
       open the 64bit shell.
     * Select "MSYS2 64bit" -> "MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit" from the "Start Menu" to
       open the 32bit shell.

    Tux Paint Config.

   "Tux Paint Config" is a useful graphical tool for tweaking Tux Paint's
   behavior. You have to build this component before compiling Tux Paint if
   you want to have it included in your package.

   You can use either (a) a stable tar-ball release, or (b) the developing
   source tree.
    a. Using stable tar-ball release:
          * Download a source tar-ball
          * Expand the tar-ball and change the directory name so that the
            final packaging process can find related files.

              $ tar zxvf tuxpaint-config-A.B.C.tar.gz
              $ mv tuxpaint-config-A.B.C tuxpaint-config

    b. Using the developing source tree:
          * Fetch the developing source tree from git repository:

              $ git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/tuxpaint/tuxpaint-config
              tuxpaint-config

   Now you can build Tux Paint Config. as follows:

     $ cd tuxpaint-config
     $ make win32

    Tux Paint

   You can use either (a) a stable tar-ball release, or (b) the developing
   source tree.
    a. Using stable tar-ball release:
          * Download a source tar-ball
          * Expand the tar-ball and change the directory name so that the
            final packaging process can find related files.

              $ tar zxvf tuxpaint-A.B.C-sdl2.tar.gz
              $ mv tuxpaint-A.B.C-sdl2 tuxpaint-sdl2

    b. Using the developing source tree:
          * Fetch the developing source tree from git repository:

              $ git clone -b sdl2.0
              https://git.code.sf.net/p/tuxpaint/tuxpaint tuxpaint-sdl2

   Now you can build Tux Paint as follows:

     $ cd tuxpaint-sdl2
     $ make bdist-win32

   All the files needed for starting Tux Paint (and Tux Paint Config.) are
   collected in the directory for binary distribution "bdist" directory under
   "win32". You can start them by double-clicking their executable (.exe)
   files in the "bdist" directory.

  Building the Tux Paint Windows Installer

   Inno Setup is used to build executable installer for Tux Paint. Therefore
   you have to install it in the first place.

   Inno Setup officially supports translations for only about 20 languages.
   However, one of the great points of Tux Paint is it supports so many
   languages. Therefore, the set up script "tuxpaint.iss" to build the
   installer is written to use much more translations including unofficial
   one which are available on "Inno Setup Translations". You have to download
   translation files (.isl) required and put them in "Languages" directory
   under the directory in which Inno Setup is installed.

   Before building an installer, edit the "tuxpaint.iss" file and enable one
   of the lines starting with "#define BuildTarget=", depending on the
   architecture of the installer you want to create.

   Then, you can easily build an executable installer by right-clicking on
   the "tuxpaint.iss" icon in the "win32" directory and selecting "Compile"
   on the list. It will run for a while, and eventually you will find a
   "tuxpaint-X.Y.Z-windows-sdl2.0-<arch>-installer.exe" file in the same
   directory.

  Running the Tux Paint Windows Installer

   Double-click the Tux Paint installer executable (.EXE file) and follow the
   instructions.

   First, you will be asked to read the license. (It is the GNU General
   Public License (GPL), which is also available as "COPYING.txt".)

   You will then be asked whether you want to install shortcuts to Tux Paint
   in your Windows Start Menu and on your Windows Desktop. (Both options are
   set by default.)

   Then you will be asked where you wish to install Tux Paint. The default
   should be suitable, as long as there is space available. Otherwise, pick a
   different location.

   At this point, you can click 'Install' to install Tux Paint!

  Changing the Settings Using the Shortcut

   To change program settings, right-click on the TuxPaint shortcut and
   select 'Properties' (at the bottom).

   Make sure the 'Shortcut' tab is selected in the window that appears, and
   examine the 'Target:' field. You should see something like this:

     "C:\Program Files\TuxPaint\TuxPaint.exe"

   You can now add command-line options which will be enabled when you
   double-click the icon.

   For example, to make the game run in fullscreen mode, with simple shapes
   (no rotation option) and in French, add the options (after
   'TuxPaint.exe'), like so:

     "C:\Program Files\TuxPaint\TuxPaint.exe" -f -s --lang french

   (See the main documentation for a full list of available command-line
   options.)

   If you make a mistake or it all disappears use [Control] + [Z] to undo or
   just hit the [Esc] key and the box will close with no changes made (unless
   you pushed the "Apply" button!).

   When you have finished, click "OK."

  If Something Goes Wrong

   If, when you double-click on the shortcut to run Tux Paint, nothing
   happens, it is probably because some of these command-line options are
   wrong. Open an Explorer, and look for a file called "stderr.txt" in your
   personal saving folder for TuxPaint which is normaly
   "C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\TuxPaint".

   It will contain a description of what was wrong. Usually it will just be
   due to incorrect character-case (capital 'Z' instead of lowercase 'z') or
   a missing (or extra) '-' (dash).

Linux/Unix

  Compiling:

   💡 Note: Tux Paint does not use autoconf/automake, so there is no
   "./configure" script to run. Compiling should be straight-forward though,
   assuming everything Tux Paint needs is installed.

   To compile the program from source, simply run the following command from
   a shell prompt (e.g., "$"):

     $ make

  Disabling SVG support (and hence Cairo, libSVG, and svg-cairo dependencies):

   To disable SVG support (e.g., if your system is not currently supported by
   the Cairo library or other SVG-related dependencies), you can run "make"
   with "SVG_LIB= SVG_CFLAGS= NOSVGFLAG=NOSVG" added:

     $ make SVG_LIB= SVG_CFLAGS=

  Disabling Pango support (and hence Pango, Cairo, etc. dependencies):

   📜 Prior to version 0.9.18, Tux Paint used the libSDL_ttf library for
   rendering text using TrueType Fonts. Since 0.9.18, libSDL_Pango is used,
   as it has much greater support for internationalization. However, if you
   wish to disable the use of SDL_Pango, you may do so running "make" with
   "SDL_PANGO_LIB=" added:

     $ make SDL_PANGO_LIB=

  Disabling Sound at Compile-time

   If you don't have a sound card, or would prefer to build the program with
   no sound support (and therefore without a the SDL_mixer dependency), you
   can run "make" with "SDL_MIXER_LIB=" added:

     $ make SDL_MIXER_LIB=

  Other options

   Various other options (e.g., installation paths) may be overridden; see
   them in "Makefile" for further details.

  If you get errors

   If you receive any errors during compile-time, make sure you have the
   appropriate libraries installed (see above). If using packaged versions of
   the libraries (e.g., RPMs under RedHat or DEBs under Debian), be sure to
   get the corresponding "-dev" or "-devel" packages as well, otherwise you
   won't be able to compile Tux Paint (and other programs) from source!

  Installng

   Assuming no fatal errors occured, you can now install the program so that
   it can be run by users on the system. By default, this must be done by the
   "root" user ('superuser'). Switch to "root" by typing the command:

     $ su

   Enter "root"'s password at the prompt. You should now be "root" (with a
   prompt like "#"). To install the program and its data files, type:

     # make install

   Finally, you can switch back to your regular user by exiting superuser
   mode:

     # exit

   Alternatively, you may be able to simply use the "sudo" command (e.g., on
   Ubuntu Linux):

     $ sudo make install

   💡 Note: By default, "tuxpaint", the executable program, is placed in
   "/usr/local/bin/". The data files (images, sounds, etc.) are placed in
   "/usr/local/share/tuxpaint/".

    Changing Where Things Go

   You can change where things will go by setting "Makefile"variables on the
   command line. "DESTDIR" is used to place output in a staging area for
   package creation. "PREFIX" is the basis of where all other files go, and
   is, by default, set to "/usr/local".

   Other variables are:

   BIN_PREFIX
           Where the "tuxpaint" binary will be installed. (Set to
           "$(PREFIX)/bin" by default - e.g., "/usr/local/bin")

   DATA_PREFIX
           Where the data files (sound, graphics, brushes, stamps, fonts)
           will go, and where Tux Paint will look for them when it's run.
           (Set to "$(PREFIX)/share/tuxpaint")

   DOC_PREFIX
           Where the documentation text files (the "docs" directory) will go.
           (Set to "$(PREFIX)/share/doc/tuxpaint")

   MAN_PREFIX
           Where the manual page for Tux Paint will go. (Set to

macOS

   junio 5, 2022 Mark Kim <markuskimius@gmail.com>

   Starting with Tux Paint 0.9.23, Tux Paint for macOS is built as though it
   were a Linux application.

  Prerequisites

   Although Tux Paint is built without the Xcode IDE, Xcode itself is still
   required to build Tux Paint. Download it from the App Store, and launch it
   once to accept its license agreements. You may also need to install the
   Xcode command line tools using the command:

     $ xcode-select --install

   Building Tux Paint also requires various libraries. We install them from
   MacPorts where possible, source code otherwise. Install MacPorts to the
   default /opt/local path according to the instructions found on their
   website: https://www.macports.org/
     * ImageMagick
     * cairo
     * fribidi
     * lbzip2
     * libimagequant^*
     * libpaper
     * libpng
     * librsvg
     * libsdl2
     * libsdl2_image
     * libsdl2_mixer
     * libsdl2_pango^*
     * libsdl2_ttf
     * libsdl2_gfx
     * pkgconfig
     * zlib
   ... but you should install any package that is required by the latest
   version of Tux Paint.

   ^* Not available from MacPorts as of this writing, see below.

    libimagequant

   libimagequant is not available from MacPorts as of this writing. It can be
   installed from the source code as follows. It should be installed to
   /opt/local (same as MacPorts) for the library to be included in
   TuxPaint.dmg.

     $ sudo port install rust cargo
     $ git clone https://github.com/ImageOptim/libimagequant.git
     $ cd libimagequant/imagequant-sys
     $ cargo build --release # Must use cargo from MacPorts
     $ sudo make PREFIX=/opt/local install

    sdl2_pango

   sdl2_pango is not available from MacPorts as of this writing. It can be
   installed from the source code as follows. It should be installed to
   /opt/local (same as MacPorts) for the library to be included in
   TuxPaint.dmg.

     $ git clone https://github.com/markuskimius/SDL2_Pango.git
     $ cd SDL2_Pango
     $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/local && make && sudo make install

   WARNING: Having any UNIX-like toolset installed on your Mac besides
   MacPorts and Xcode, such as Fink or Brew, will prevent your app bundle
   from being portable. Be sure Fink and Brew are not accessible from your
   build environment.

  How to Build

   Simply, run:

     % make
     % make install

   ... to create the TuxPaint.app application bundle that can be run in-place
   or copied to /Applications. To create the DMG file for distribution, use
   'make TuxPaint.dmg'.

   Additional steps may be required when building for the Apple Silicon. See
   "Building for Apple Silicon" below.

  Known Issues

     * A macOS binary built on a specific version of macOS only runs on that
       version of macOS or later. To ensure Tux Paint can run on the oldest
       version of macOS possible, build it on the oldest version of macOS
       available. As of this writing we know Tux Paint cannot be built to run
       on macOS 10.7 or earlier.

       See "Old Versions of macOS" below for best-effort instructions on how
       to obtain, install, and build Tux Paint on an old version of macOS.

       Alternatively, Tux Paint and all of its library dependencies may be
       compiled with appropriate options to be runnable on older versions of
       macOS. These options are already set on Tux Paint, so only its
       dependencies (from MacPorts) need to be recompiled. See "Recompiling
       MacPorts" below for the instructions.

  Old Versions of macOS

   Some old versions of macOS can be downloaded from Apple's support page:
   https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211683

   macOS for Intel CPU does allow dual booting of multiple versions of the
   OS, but it's safer and easier to install the old macOS onto a flash drive.
   Wherever you're installing it, the target drive's partitioniong scheme and
   partition type must match what the old macOS expects, so use the Disk
   Utility to partition and format the flash drive accordingly.

   Dual booting multiple versions of macOS for Apple Silicon has been so far
   unsuccessful. Instead of installing an older version of macOS for Apple
   Silicon to build Tux Paint to run on the old version of macOS for Apple
   Silicon, use the instructions found in the "Recompiling MacPorts" section
   to build Tux Paint to run on older versions of macOS for Apple Silicon.

   As of this writing, the oldest version of macOS available on Apple's
   support site is Yosemite 10.10, which expects "GPT (GUID Partition Table)"
   partitioning scheme instead of the older MBR scheme, and "Mac OS Extended
   (Journaled)" as the partition type instead of the newer APFS partition
   type.

   Upon launching the installer, if you get a popup about macOS being too old
   or new to be installed, a bootable installer can be created using the
   instructions found here: https://support.apple.com/en-mide/HT201372

   Once the old macOS is installed, you may find the Xcode on the App Store
   is too new to run on the version of the old macOS. Old versions of Xcode
   can be downloaded from Apple's Developer site in an area accessible with
   free registration: https://developer.apple.com/download/more/

   The list of macOS versions and the last version of Xcode compatible with
   them are laid out nicely on the Wikipedia page on Xcode:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode#Version_comparison_table

   And because Xcode is being installed manually, you can skip the step to
   install the Xcode command line tools (do not run "xcode-select --install")
   but otherwise build Tux Paint using the same steps described in the
   earlier part of this document.

  Recompiling MacPorts

   To recompile MacPorts to be usable on older versions of macOS, set the
   following options in /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf:

     buildfromsource always
     macosx_deployment_target 10.10

   Then uninstall all MacPorts packages:

     $ sudo port -fp uninstall installed

   Then reinstall all MacPorts packages needed by Tux Paint. Also rebuild
   libimagequant using the updated Cargo package from MacPorts.

   As of this writing, all libraries Tux Paint requires from MacPorts can be
   recompiled in this manner to run on macOS 10.10 Yosemite and later on
   Intel CPUs, and macOS 11.0 Big Sur and later on Apple Silicon.
   Unfortunately, although MacPorts has the option to enable the building of
   universal libraries, several libraries Tux Paint require cannot be built
   as universal libraries so they can only be built to run natively on the
   hardware on which they were built. See "Building a Universal Binary" below
   for instructions on how to build Tux Paint as a Universal Binary.

  Building for Apple Silicon

   macOS for Applie Silicon requires all native Apple Silicon applications be
   signed, even if it is signed "ad-hoc" (anonymously). Because of this,
   compilers that produce native Apple Silicon applications sign all produced
   binaries and libraries as a part of the compilation process.^* However,
   the Tux Paint compilation process modifies the libraries to be modular
   (using install_name_tool) so they can be added into the application
   bundle, which has the unfortunate side effect of breaking the signature.
   This can be addressed by signing the application bundle ad-hoc (example
   below) or using your own Apple Developer Identity if you have one. The DMG
   file, if needed, must be created after signing the App Bundle so the DMG
   file is created with signed App Bundle:

     $ codesign -s - TuxPaint.app
     $ make TuxPaint.dmg

   ^* For more information on the code signing requirements on the Apple
   Silicon, see
   https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-big-sur-11_0_1-universal-apps-release-notes#:~:text=New%20in%20macOS,pass%20through%20Gatekeeper.

   If you get an error that the application bundle is already signed, remove
   it before signing::

     $ codesign --remove-signature TuxPaint.app

   If you plan to combine the Apple Silicon bundle with the Intel CPU bundle
   to produce the Universal bundle, the code signing must be done after they
   are combined. See "Building a Universal Binary" below.

  Building a Universal Binary

   To build Tux Paint as a Universal Binary, compile Tux Paint for the Intel
   CPU and the Apple Silicon separately first. Then rename the app bundle for
   the Intel CPU to TuxPaint-x86_64.app, and the bundle for the Apple Silicon
   to TuxPaint-arm64.app, copy the app bundle from the Intel machine to the
   Apple Silicon machine, then use the provided build-universal.sh script to
   combine the two application bundles as below. The produced bundle must be
   signed (see "Building for Apple Silicon" above for more details). The DMG
   file, if required, must be built after the signing:

     $ macos/build-universal.sh
     $ codesign -s - TuxPaint.app
     $ make TuxPaint.dmg

                                   Debugging

   ⚙ Debugging output — to "STDOUT" on Linux and Unix, to a "stdout.txt" file
   on Windows, and to the file "/tmp/tuxpaint.log" on macOS — can be enabled
   by setting "DEBUG" (and, if verbose logging is wanted, "VERBOSE") #defines
   in "src/debug.h" and (re)compiling Tux Paint.

                             Uninstalling Tux Paint

Windows

  Using the Uninstaller

   If you installed the Start Menu shortcuts (the default), then go to the
   TuxPaint folder and select "Uninstall". A box will be displayed that will
   confirm that you are about to uninstall Tux Paint and, if you are certain
   that you want to permanently remove Tux Paint, click on the 'Uninstall'
   button.

   When it has finished, click on the close button.

  Using the Control Panel

   It is also possible to use the entry "TuxPaint (remove only)" in the
   Control Panel Add/Remove programs section.

macOS

   Delete "TuxPaint.app" from the "Applications" folder. Data files,
   including the configuration files, stamps, and saved pictures, may be
   found in "/Library/Application Support/TuxPaint" (all users) and
   "/Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/TuxPaint" (individual users).

Linux

   Within the Tux Paint source directory (where you compiled Tux Paint), you
   can use the "make uninstall" target to uninstall Tux Paint. By default,
   this must be done by the "root" user ('superuser'), but if you installed
   Tux Paint somewhere else (e.g., using a "PREFIX=..." setting to "make" and
   "make install"), you may not, and will want to provide those same settings
   here. (See the installation instructions above for further information.)
