                                About Tux Paint

What Is "Tux Paint"?

   Tux Paint is a free drawing program designed for young children (kids ages
   3 and up). It has a simple, easy-to-use interface, fun sound effects, and
   an encouraging cartoon mascot who helps guide children as they use the
   program. It provides a blank canvas and a variety of drawing tools to help
   your child be creative.

License

   Tux Paint is an Open Source project, Free Software released under the GNU
   General Public License (GPL). It is free, and the 'source code' behind the
   program is available. (This allows others to add features, fix bugs, and
   use parts of the program in their own GPL'd software.)

   See COPYING.txt for the full text of the GPL license.

Objectives

   Easy and Fun
           Tux Paint is meant to be a simple drawing program for young
           children. It is not meant as a general-purpose drawing tool. It is
           meant to be fun and easy to use. Sound effects and a cartoon
           character help let the user know what's going on, and keeps them
           entertained. There are also extra-large cartoon-style mouse
           pointer shapes.

   Extensibility
           Tux Paint is extensible. Brushes and 'rubber stamp' shapes can be
           dropped in and pulled out. For example, a teacher can drop in a
           collection of animal shapes and ask their students to draw an
           ecosystem. Each shape can have a sound which is played, and
           textual facts which are displayed, when the child selects the
           shape.

   Portability
           Tux Paint is portable among various computer platforms: Windows,
           Macintosh, Linux, etc. The interface looks the same among them
           all. Tux Paint runs suitably well on older systems, and can be
           built to run better on slow systems.

   Simplicity
           There is no direct access to the computer's underlying
           intricacies. The current image is kept when the program quits, and
           reappears when it is restarted. Saving images requires no need to
           create filenames or use the keyboard. Opening an image is done by
           selecting it from a collection of thumbnails. Access to other
           files on the computer is restricted.

                                Using Tux Paint

Launching Tux Paint

  Linux/Unix Users

   Tux Paint should have placed a launcher icon in your KDE and/or GNOME
   menus, under 'Graphics.'

   Alternatively, you can run the following command at a shell prompt (e.g.,
   "$"):

     $ tuxpaint

   If any errors occur, they will be displayed on the terminal (to STDERR).

  Windows Users

                                                            [Tux Paint Icon]  
                                                               Tux Paint      

   If you installed Tux Paint on your computer using the 'Tux Paint
   Installer,' it will have asked you whether you wanted a 'Start' menu
   short-cut, and/or a desktop shortcut. If you agreed, you can simply run
   Tux Paint from the 'Tux Paint' section of your 'Start' menu (e.g., under
   'All Programs'), or by double-clicking the 'Tux Paint' icon on your
   desktop, if you had the installer place one there.

   If you're using the 'portable' (ZIP-file) version of Tux Paint, or if you
   used the 'Tux Paint Installer,' but chose not to have shortcuts installed,
   you'll need to double-click the "tuxpaint.exe" icon in the "Tux Paint"
   folder on your computer.

   By default, the 'Tux Paint Installer' will put Tux Paint's folder in
   "C:\Program Files\", though you may have changed this when you ran the
   installer.

   If you used the 'ZIP-file' download, Tux Paint's folder will be wherever
   you extracted the contents of the ZIP file.

  macOS Users

   Simply double-click the "Tux Paint" icon.

   [Title screen]

Title Screen

   When Tux Paint first loads, a title/credits screen will appear.

   Once loading is complete, press a key or click or tap in the Tux Paint
   window to continue. (Or, after about 5 seconds, the title screen will go
   away automatically.)

Main Screen

   The main screen is divided into the following sections:

   [Tools: Paint, Stamp, Lines, Shapes, Text, Magic, Label, Undo, Redo,
   Eraser, New, Open, Save, Print, Quit]

   Left Side: Toolbar

           The toolbar contains the drawing and editing controls.

           [Canvas]

   Middle: Drawing Canvas

           The largest part of the screen, in the center, is the drawing
           canvas. This is, obviously, where you draw!

           ðŸ’¡ Note: The size of the drawing canvas depends on the size of Tux
           Paint. You can change the size of Tux Paint using the Tux Paint
           Config. configuration tool, or by other means. See the Options
           documentation for more details.

           [Selectors - Brushes, Letters, Shapes, Stamps]

   Right Side: Selector

           Depending on the current tool, the selector shows different
           things. e.g., when the Paint Brush or Line tool is selected, it
           shows the various brushes available. When the Rubber Stamp tool is
           selected, it shows the different shapes you can use. When the Text
           or Label tool is selected, it shows various fonts.

           [Colors - Black, White, Red, Pink, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan,
           Blue, Purple, Brown, Grey]

   Lower: Colors

           When the active tool supports colors, a palette of colors choices
           will be shown near the bottom of the screen. Click one to choose a
           color, and it will be used by the active tool. (For example, the
           "Paint" tool will use it as the color to draw with the chosen
           brush, and the "Fill" tool will use it as the color to use when
           flood-filling an area of the picture.)

           On the far right are three special color options:
              * Color Picker
                The "color picker" (which has an outline of an eye-dropper)
                allows you to pick a color found within your drawing.
                (A shortcut key is available to access this feature quickly;
                see below.)
              * Rainbow Palette
                The rainbow palette allows you to pick any color by choosing
                the hue, saturation, and value of the color you want. A box
                on the left displays hundreds of hues â€” from red at the top
                through to violet at the bottom â€” at hundreds of
                saturation/intensity levels â€” from pale & washed-out on the
                left through to pure on the right. A grey vertical bar
                provides access to hundreds of value levels â€” from lighest at
                the top through to darkest at the bottom.
                Click the green checkbox button to select the color, or the
                "Back" button to dismiss the pop-up without picking a new
                color.
              * Color Mixer
                The "color mixer" (which has silhouette of a paint palette)
                allows you to create colors by blending primary additive
                colors â€” red, yellow, and blue â€” along with white (to
                "tint"), grey (to "tone"), and black (to "shade").
                You may click any button multiple times (for example, red +
                red + yellow results in a red-orange color). The ratios of
                colors added are shown at the bottom.
                You can start over (reset to no colors in your picture) by
                clicking the "Clear" button. You can also undo or redo
                multiple steps of mixing, in case you made a mistake (without
                having to start over).
                Click the green checkbox button to select the color, or the
                "Back" button to dismiss the pop-up without picking a new
                color.

           âŒ¨ When the active tool supports colors, a shortcut may be used to
           access the "color picker" option more quickly. Hold the [Control]
           key while clicking, and the color under the mouse cursor will be
           shown at the bottom. You may drag around to canvas to find the
           color you want. When you release the mouse button, the color under
           the cursor will be selected. If you release the mouse outside of
           the canvas (e.g., over the "Tools" area), the color selection will
           be left unchanged. (This is similar to clicking the"Back" button
           that's available when bringing up the "color picker" option via
           its button the color palette.)

           âš™ Note: You can define your own colors for Tux Paint. See the
           "Options" documentation.

           (Example tip: 'Pick a shape. Click to pick the center, drag, then
           let go when it is the size you want. Move around to rotate it, and
           click to draw it.')

   Bottom: Help Area

           At the very bottom of the screen, Tux, the Linux Penguin, provides
           tips and other information while you use Tux Paint.

Available Tools

  Drawing Tools

   "Paint" Tool (Brush)

           The Paint Brush tool lets you draw freehand, using various brushes
           (chosen in the Selector on the right) and colors (chosen in the
           Color palette towards the bottom).

           If you hold the mouse button down, and move the mouse, it will
           draw as you move.

           Some brushes are animated â€” they change their shape as you draw
           them. A good example of this is the vines brush that ships with
           Tux Paint. These brushes will have a small "filmstrip" icon drawn
           on their Selector buttons.

           Other brushes are directional â€” they will draw a different shape
           depending on what direction you are painting with them. An example
           of this is the arrow brush that ships with Tux Paint. These
           brushes have a small 8-way arrow icon drawn on their Selector
           buttons.

           Finally, some brushes can be both direction and animated. Examples
           of this are the cat and squirrel brushes that ship with Tux Paint.
           These brushes will have both the "filmstrip" and 8-way arrow
           icons.

           As you draw, a sound is played. The bigger the brush, the lower
           the pitch.

           Brush Spacing

             The space between each position where a brush is applied to the
             canvas can vary. Some brushes (such as the footprints and
             flower) are spaced, by default, far enough apart that they don't
             overlap. Other brushes (such as the basic circular ones) are
             spaced closely, so they make a continuous stroke.

             The default spacing of brushes may be overridden using by
             clicking within the triangular-shaped series of bars at the
             bottom right; the larger the bar, the wider the spacing. Brush
             spacing affects both tools that use the brushes: the "Paint"
             tool and the "Lines" tool.

             âš™ Note: If the "nobrushspacing" option is set, Tux Paint won't
             display the brush spacing controls. See the "Options"
             documentation.

   "Stamp" Tool (Rubber Stamps)

           The Stamp tool is like a set of rubber stamps or stickers. It lets
           you paste pre-drawn or photographic images (like a picture of a
           horse, or a tree, or the moon) in your picture.

           As you move the mouse around the canvas, an outline follows the
           mouse, showing where the stamp will be placed, and how big it will
           be. Click to place the stamp.

           There can be numerous categories of stamps (e.g., animals, plants,
           outer space, vehicles, people, etc.). Use the Left and Right
           arrows near the bottom of the Selector to cycle through the
           collections.

           Prior to 'stamping' an image onto your drawing, various effects
           can sometimes be applied (depending on the stamp):

              * Some stamps can be colored or tinted. If the color palette
                below the canvas is activated, you can click the colors to
                change the tint or color of the stamp before placing it in
                the picture.
              * Stamps can be shrunk and expanded, by clicking within the
                triangular-shaped series of bars at the bottom right; the
                larger the bar, the larger the stamp will appear in your
                picture.
              * Many stamps may be flipped vertically, or displayed as a
                mirror-image, using the control buttons at the bottom right.

           Different stamps can have different sound effects and/or
           descriptive (spoken) sounds. Buttons in the Help Area at the lower
           left (near Tux, the Linux penguin) allow you to re-play the sound
           effects and descriptive sounds for the currently-selected stamp.

           âš™ Note: If the "nostampcontrols" option is set, Tux Paint won't
           display the Mirror, Flip, Shrink and Grow controls for stamps. See
           the "Options" documentation.

   "Lines" Tool

           This tool lets you draw straight lines using the various brushes
           and colors you normally use with the Paint Brush.

           Click the mouse and hold it to choose the starting point of the
           line. As you move the mouse around, a thin 'rubber-band' line will
           show where the line will be drawn. At the bottom, you'll see the
           angle of your line, in degrees. A line going straight to the right
           is 0Â°, a line going straight up is 90Â°, a line going straight left
           is 180Â°, a line going straight down is 270Â°, and so on.

           Let go of the mouse to complete the line. A "sproing!" sound will
           play.

           Some brushes are animated, and will show a pattern of shapes along
           the line. Others are directional, and will show a different shape
           depending on the angle of the brush. And finally some are both
           animated and directional. See "Paint", above, to learn more.

           Different brushes have different spacing, leaving either a series
           of individual shapes, or a continuous stroke of the brush shape.
           Brush spacing may be adjusted. See "Paint", above, to learn more.

   "Shapes" Tool

           This tool lets you draw some simple filled, and un-filled shapes.

           Select a shape from the selector on the right (circle, square,
           oval, etc.).

           Use the options at the bottom right to choose the shape tool's
           behavior:

                Shapes from center
                        The shape will expand from where you initially
                        clicked, and will be centered around that position.

                        ðŸ“œ This was Tux Paint's only behavior through version
                        0.9.24.)

                Shapes from corner
                        The shape will extend with one corner starting from
                        where you initially clicked. This is the default
                        method of most other traditional drawing software.

                        ðŸ“œ This option was added starting with Tux Paint
                        version 0.9.25.)

           âš™ Note: If shape controls are disabled (e.g., with the
           "noshapecontrols" option), the controls will not be presented, and
           the "shapes from center" method will be used.

           In the canvas, click the mouse and hold it to stretch the shape
           out from where you clicked. Some shapes can change proportion
           (e.g., rectangle and oval may be wider than tall, or taller than
           wide), others cannot (e.g., square and circle).

           For shapes that can change proportion, the aspect ratio of the
           shape will be shown at the bottom. For example: "1:1" will be
           shown if it is "square" (as tall as it is wide); "2:1" if it is
           either twice as wide as it is tall, or twice as tall as it is
           wide; and so on.

           Let go of the mouse when you're done stretching.

                        Now you can move the mouse around the canvas to
                        rotate the shape. The angle your shape is rotated
                        will be shown at the bottom, in degrees (similar to
                        the "Lines" tool, described above).

                        Click the mouse button again and the shape will be
                        drawn in the current color.

                Simple Shapes Mode
                        If the "simple shapes" option is enabled, the shape
                        will be drawn on the canvas when you let go of the
                        mouse button. (There's no rotation step.)

                        âš™ See the "Options" documentation to learn about the
                        "simple shapes" ("simpleshapes") option.

   "Text" and "Label" Tools

           Choose a font (from the 'Letters' available on the right) and a
           color (from the color palette near the bottom). You may also apply
           a bold, and/or an italic styling effect to the text. Click on the
           screen and a cursor will appear. Type text and it will show up on
           the screen. (You can change the font, color, and styling while
           entering the text, before it is applied to the canvas.)

           Press [Enter] or [Return] and the text will be drawn onto the
           picture and the cursor will move down one line.

           Alternatively, press [Tab] and the text will be drawn onto the
           picture, but the cursor will move to the right of the text, rather
           than down a line, and to the left. (This can be useful to create a
           line of text with mixed colors, fonts, styles and sizes.)

           Clicking elsewhere in the picture while the text entry is still
           active causes the current line of text to move to that location
           (where you can continue editing it).

                "Text" versus "Label"

                        The Text tool is the original text-entry tool in Tux
                        Paint. Text entered using this tool can't be modified
                        or moved later, since it becomes part of the drawing.
                        However, because the text becomes part of the
                        picture, it can be drawn over or modified using Magic
                        tool effects (e.g., smudged, tinted, embossed, etc.)

                        When using the Label tool (which was added to Tux
                        Paint in version 0.9.22), the text 'floats' over the
                        image, and the details of the label (the text, the
                        position of the label, the font choice and the color)
                        get stored separately. This allows the label to be
                        repositioned or edited later.

                        To edit a label, click the label selection button.
                        All labels in the drawing will appear highlighted.
                        Click one â€” or use the [Tab] key to cycle through all
                        the labels, and the [Enter] or [Return] key to select
                        one â€” and you may then edit the label. (Use they
                        [Backspace] key to erase characters, and other keys
                        to add text to the label; click in the canvas to
                        reposition the label; click in the palette to change
                        the color of the text in the label; etc.)

                        You may "apply" a label to the canvas, painting the
                        text into the picture as if it had been added using
                        the Text tool, by clicking the label application
                        button. (This feature was added in Tux Paint version
                        0.9.28.) All labels in the drawing will appear
                        highlighted, and you select one just as you do when
                        selecting a label to edit. The chosen label will be
                        removed, and the text will be added directly to the
                        canvas.

                        âš™ The Label tool can be disabled (e.g., by selecting
                        "Disable 'Label' Tool" in Tux Paint Config. or
                        running Tux Paint with the "nolabel" option).

                International Character Input

                        Tux Paint allows inputting characters in different
                        languages. Most Latin characters (A-Z, Ã±, Ã¨, etc.)
                        can by entered directly. Some languages require that
                        Tux Paint be switched into an alternate input mode
                        before entering, and some characters must be composed
                        using numerous keypresses.

                        When Tux Paint's locale is set to one of the
                        languages that provide alternate input modes, a key
                        is used to cycle through normal (Latin character) and
                        locale-specific mode or modes.

                        Currently supported locales, the input methods
                        available, and the key to toggle or cycle modes, are
                        listed below.

                           * Japanese â€” Romanized Hiragana and Romanized
                             Katakana â€” right [Alt] key or left [Alt] key
                           * Korean â€” Hangul 2-Bul â€” right [Alt] key or left
                             [Alt] key
                           * Traditional Chinese â€” right [Alt] key or left
                             [Alt] key
                           * Thai â€” right [Alt] key

                        ðŸ’¡ Note: Many fonts do not include all characters for
                        all languages, so sometimes you'll need to change
                        fonts to see the characters you're trying to type.

                On-screen Keyboard

                        An optional on-screen keyboard is available for the
                        Text and Label tools, which can provide a variety of
                        layouts and character composition (e.g., composing
                        "a" and "e" into "Ã¦").

                        âš™ See the "Options" and "Extending Tux Paint"
                        documentation for more information.

   "Fill" Tool

           The 'Fill' tool 'flood-fills' a contiguous area of your drawing
           with a color of your choice. Three fill options are offered:
              * Solid â€” click once to fill an area with a solid color.
              * Brush â€” click and drag to fill an area with a solid color
                using freehand painting.
              * Linear â€” click and then drag to fill the area with color that
                fades away (a gradient) towards where you drag the mouse.
              * Radial â€” click once to fill an area with a color that fades
                away (a gradient) radially, centered on where you clicked.

           ðŸ“œ Note: Prior to Tux Paint 0.9.24, "Fill" was a Magic tool (see
           below). Prior to Tux Paint 0.9.26, the "Fill" tool only offered
           the 'Solid' method of filling.

   "Magic" Tool (Special Effects)

           The Magic tool is actually a set of special tools. Select one of
           the 'magic' effects from the selector on the right. Then,
           depending on the tool, you can either click and drag around the
           picture, and/or simply click the picture once, to apply the
           effect.

           If the tool can be used by clicking and dragging, a 'painting'
           button will be available on the left, below the list of Magic
           tools on the right side of the screen. If the tool can affect the
           entire picture at once, an 'entire picture' button will be
           available on the right.

           See the instructions for each Magic tool (in the 'magic-docs'
           folder).

   "Eraser" Tool

           This tool is similar to the Paint Brush. Wherever you click (or
           click and drag), the picture will be erased. (This may be white,
           some other color, or to a background picture, depending on the
           picture.)

           A number of eraser sizes are available, both round and square.

           As you move the mouse around, a square outline follows the
           pointer, showing what part of the picture will be erased to white.

           As you erase, a 'squeaky clean' eraser wiping sound is played.

  Other Controls

   "Undo" and "Redo" Commands

           Clicking the "Undo" button will undo (revert) the last drawing
           action. You can even undo more than once!

           âŒ¨ Note: You can also press [Control / âŒ˜] + [Z] on the keyboard to
           Undo.

           Clicking the "Redo" button will redo the drawing action you just
           un-did via the "Undo" command.

           As long as you don't draw again, you can redo as many times as you
           had undone!

           âŒ¨ Note: You can also press [Control / âŒ˜] + [R] on the keyboard to
           Redo.

   "New" Command

           Clicking the 'New' button will start a new drawing. A dialog will
           appear where you may choose to start a new picture using a solid
           background color, or using a 'Starter' or 'Template' image (see
           below). You will first be asked whether you really want to do
           this.

           âŒ¨ Note: You can also press [Control / âŒ˜] + [N] on the keyboard to
           start a new drawing.

           Special Solid Background Color Choices

             Along with the preset solid colors, you can also choose colors
             using a rainbow palette or a "color mixer". These operate
             identically to the options found in the color palette shown
             below the canvas when drawing a picture. See Main Screen >
             Lower: Colors > Special color options for details.

           'Starter' & Template Images

             'Starters' can behave like a page from a coloring book â€” a
             black-and-white outline of a picture, which you can then color
             in, and the black outline remains intact â€” or like a 3D
             photograph, where you draw in between a foreground and
             background layer.

             'Templates' are similar, but simply provide a background drawing
             to work off of. Unlike 'Starters', there is no layer that
             remains in the foreground of anything you draw in the picture.

             When using the 'Eraser' tool, the original image from the
             'Starter' or 'Template' will reappear. The 'Flip' and 'Mirror'
             Magic tools affect the orientation of the 'Starter' or
             'Template', as well.

             When you load a 'Starter' or 'Template', draw on it, and then
             click 'Save,' it creates a new picture file â€” it doesn't
             overwrite the original, so you can use it again later (by
             accessing it from the 'New' dialog).

   "Open" Command

           This shows you a list of all of the pictures you've saved. If
           there are more than can fit on the screen, use the up and down
           arrows at the top and bottom of the list to scroll through the
           list of pictures.

           Click a picture to select it, and then...
              * Click the green 'Open' button at the lower left of the list
                to load the selected picture.

                (Alternatively, you can double-click a picture's icon to load
                it.)

                ðŸ’¡ If choose to open a picture, and your current drawing
                hasn't been saved, you will be prompted as to whether you
                want to save it or not. (See "Save," below.)

              * Click the brown 'Erase' (trash can) button at the lower right
                of the list to erase the selected picture. (You will be asked
                to confirm.)

                ðŸ“œ Note: On Linux (as of version 0.9.22) and Windows (as of
                version 0.9.27), the picture will be placed in your desktop's
                trash can / recycle bin (where you may recover and restore
                it, if you change your mind).

              * Click the 'Export' button near the lower right to export the
                image to your export folder. (e.g., "~/Pictures/TuxPaint/")

           From the "Open" screen you can also:
              * Click the blue 'Slides' (slide projector) button at the lower
                left to go to slideshow mode. See "Slides", below, for
                details.

              * Click the red 'Back' arrow button at the lower right of the
                list to cancel and return to the picture you were drawing.

           âŒ¨ Note: You can also press [Control / âŒ˜] + [O] on the keyboard to
           bring up the 'Open' dialog.

   "Save" Command

           This saves your current picture.

           If you haven't saved it before, it will create a new entry in the
           list of saved images. (i.e., it will create a new file)

           ðŸ’¡ Note: It won't ask you anything (e.g., for a filename). It will
           simply save the picture, and play a "camera shutter" sound effect.

           If you have saved the picture before, or this is a picture you
           just loaded using the "Open" command, you will first be asked
           whether you want to save over the old version, or create a new
           entry (a new file).

           âš™ Note: If either the "saveover" or "saveovernew" options are set,
           it won't ask before saving over. See the "Options" documentation.

           âŒ¨ Note: You can also press [Control / âŒ˜] + [S] on the keyboard to
           save.

   "Print" Command

           Click this button and your picture will be printed!

           On most platforms, you can also hold the [Alt] key (called
           [Option] on Macs) while clicking the 'Print' button to get a
           printer dialog. Note that this may not work if you're running Tux
           Paint in fullscreen mode. See below.

                Disabling Printing

                        The "noprint" option can be set, which will disable
                        Tux Paint's 'Print' button.

                        âš™ See the "Options" documentation.

                Restricting Printing

                        The "printdelay" option can be set, which will only
                        allow occasional printing â€” once every so many
                        seconds, as configured by you.

                        For example, with "printdelay=60" in Tux Paint's
                        configuration file, printing can only occur once per
                        minute (60 seconds).

                        âš™ See the "Options" documentation.

                Printing Commands

                        (Linux and Unix only)

                        Tux Paint prints by generating a PostScript
                        representation of the drawing and sending it to an
                        external program. By default, the program is:

                          lpr

                        This command can be changed by setting a
                        "printcommand" option in Tux Paint's configuration
                        file.

                        An alternative print command can be invoked by
                        holding the "[Alt]" key on the keyboard while
                        clicking clicking the 'Print' button, as long as
                        you're not in fullscreen mode, an alternative program
                        is run. By default, the program is KDE's graphical
                        print dialog:

                          kprinter

                        This command can be changed by setting a
                        "altprintcommand" option in Tux Paint's configuration
                        file.

                        âš™ See the "Options" documentation.

                Printer Settings

                        (Windows and macOS)

                        By default, Tux Paint simply prints to the default
                        printer with default settings when the 'Print' button
                        is pushed.

                        However, if you hold the [Alt] (or [Option]) key on
                        the keyboard while clicking the 'Print' button, as
                        long as you're not in fullscreen mode, your operating
                        system's printer dialog will appear, where you can
                        change the settings.

                        You can have the printer configuration changes stored
                        between Tux Paint sessions by setting the "printcfg"
                        option.

                        If the "printcfg" option is used, printer settings
                        will be loaded from the file "printcfg.cfg" in your
                        personal folder (see below). Any changes will be
                        saved there as well.

                        âš™ See the "Options" documentation.

                Printer Dialog Options

                        By default, Tux Paint only shows the printer dialog
                        (or, on Linux/Unix, runs the "altprintcommand"; e.g.,
                        "kprinter" instead of "lpr") if the [Alt] (or
                        [Option]) key is held while clicking the 'Print'
                        button.

                        However, this behavior can be changed. You can have
                        the printer dialog always appear by using
                        "--altprintalways" on the command-line, or
                        "altprint=always" in Tux Paint's configuration file.
                        Conversely, you can prevent the [Alt]/[Option] key
                        from having any effect by using "--altprintnever", or
                        "altprint=never".

                        âš™ See the "Options" documentation.

   "Slides" Command (under "Open")

           The 'Slides' button is available in the 'Open' dialog. It can be
           used to play a simple animation within Tux Paint, or a slideshow
           of pictures. It can also export an animated GIF based on the
           chosen images.

                Chosing pictures

                        When you enter the 'Slides' section of Tux Paint, it
                        displays a list of your saved files, just like the
                        'Open' dialog.

                        Click each of the images you wish to display in a
                        slideshow-style presentation, one by one. A digit
                        will appear over each image, letting you know in
                        which order they will be displayed.

                        You can click a selected image to unselect it (take
                        it out of your slideshow). Click it again if you wish
                        to add it to the end of the list.

                Set playback speed

                        A sliding scale at the lower left of the screen (next
                        to the 'Play' button) can be used to adjust the speed
                        of the slideshow or animated GIF, from slowest to
                        fastest. Choose the leftmost setting to disable
                        automatic advancement during playback within Tux
                        Paint â€” you will need to press a key or click to go
                        to the next slide (see below).

                        ðŸ’¡ Note: The slowest setting does not automatically
                        advance through the slides. Use it for when you want
                        to step through them manually. (This does not apply
                        to an exported animated GIF.)

                Playback in Tux Paint

                        To play a slideshow within Tux Paint, click the
                        'Play' button.

                        ðŸ’¡ Note: If you hadn't selected any images, then all
                        of your saved images will be played in the slideshow!

                        During the slideshow, press [Space], [Enter] or
                        [Return], or the [Right arrow] â€” or click the 'Next'
                        button at the lower left â€” to manually advance to the
                        next slide. Press [Left arrow] to go back to the
                        previous slide.

                        Press [Escape], or click the 'Back' button at the
                        lower right, to exit the slideshow and return to the
                        slideshow image selection screen.

                Exporting an animated GIF

                        Click the 'GIF Export' button near the lower right to
                        have Tux Paint generate an animated GIF file based on
                        the selected images.

                        ðŸ’¡ Note: At least two images must be selected. (To
                        export a single image, use the 'Export' option from
                        the main 'Open' dialog.) If no images are selected,
                        Tux Paint will not attempt to generate a GIF based on
                        all saved images.

                        Pressing [Escape] during the export process will
                        abort the process, and return you to the 'Slideshow'
                        dialog.

           Click 'Back' in the slideshow image selection screen to return to
           the 'Open' dialog.

   "Quit" Command

           Clicking the 'Quit' button, closing the Tux Paint window, or
           pushing the [Escape] key will quit Tux Paint.

           You will first be prompted as to whether you really want to quit.

           If you choose to quit, and you haven't saved the current picture,
           you will first be asked if wish to save it. If it's not a new
           image, you will then be asked if you want to save over the old
           version, or create a new entry. (See "Save" above.)

           âš™ Note: If the image is saved, it will be reloaded automatically
           the next time you run Tux Paint -- unless the "startblank" option
           is set.

           âš™ Note: The 'Quit' button within Tux Paint, and quitting via the
           [Escape] key, may be disabled, via the "noquit" option.

           In that case, the "window close" button on Tux Paint's title bar
           (if not in fullscreen mode) or the [Alt] + [F4] key sequence may
           be used to quit.

           If neither of those are possible, the key sequence of [Shift] +
           [Control / âŒ˜] + [Escape] may be used to quit.

           âš™ See the "Options" documentation.

   Sound Muting

           There is no on-screen control button at this time, but by using
           the [Alt] + [S] keyboard sequence, sound effects can be disabled
           and re-enabled (muted and unmuted) while the program is running.

           Note that if sounds are completely disabled via the "nosound"
           option, the [Alt] + [S] key combination has no effect. (i.e., it
           cannot be used to turn on sounds when the parent/teacher wants
           them disabled.)

           âš™ See the "Options" documentation.

                     Loading Other Pictures into Tux Paint

   Tux Paint's 'Open' dialog only displays pictures you created with Tux
   Paint. So what do you do if you want to load some other drawinng or even a
   photograph into Tux Paint, so you can edit or draw on it?

   You can simply convert the picture to the format Tux Paint uses â€” PNG
   (Portable Network Graphic) â€” and place it in Tux Paint's "saved"
   directory/folder. Here is where to find it (by default):

   Windows 10, 8, 7, Vista
           Inside the user's "AppData" folder, e.g.:
           "C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\TuxPaint\saved\".

   Windows 2000, XP
           Inside the user's "Application Data" folder, e.g.: "C:\Documents
           and Settings\username\Application Data\TuxPaint\saved\".

   macOS
           Inside the user's "Library" folder, e.g.:
           "/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Tux Paint/saved/".

   Linux/Unix
           Inside a hidden ".tuxpaint" directory, in the user's home
           directory ("$HOME"), e.g. "/home/username/.tuxpaint/saved/".

   ðŸ’¡ Note: It is also from this folder that you can copy or open pictures
   drawn in Tux Paint using other applications, though the 'Export' option
   from Tux Paint's 'Open' dialog can be used to copy them to a location
   that's easier and safer to access.

Using the import script, "tuxpaint-import"

     Linux and Unix users can use the "tuxpaint-import" shell script which
     gets installed when you install Tux Paint. It uses some NetPBM tools to
     convert the image ("anytopnm"), resize it so that it will fit in Tux
     Paint's canvas ("pnmscale"), and convert it to a PNG ("pnmtopng").

     It also uses the "date" command to get the current time and date, which
     is the file-naming convention Tux Paint uses for saved files. (Remember,
     you are never asked for a 'filename' when you go to save or open
     pictures!)

     To use this script, simply run it from a command-line prompt, and
     provide it the name(s) of the file(s) you wish to convert.

     They will be converted and placed in your Tux Paint "saved" directory.

     ðŸ’¡ Note: If you're doing this for a different user (e.g., your child)
     you'll need to make sure to run the command under their account.)

     Example:

       $ tuxpaint-import grandma.jpg
       grandma.jpg -> /home/username/.tuxpaint/saved/20211231012359.png
       jpegtopnm: WRITING A PPM FILE

     The first line ("tuxpaint-import grandma.jpg") is the command to run.
     The following two lines are output from the program while it's working.

     Now you can load Tux Paint, and a version of that original picture will
     be available under the 'Open' dialog. Just double-click its icon!

Importing Pictures Manually

     Windows, macOS, and Haiku users who wish to import arbitrary images into
     Tux Paint must do so via a manual process.

     Load a graphics program that is capable of both loading your picture and
     saving a PNG format file. (See the documentation file "PNG.html" for a
     list of suggested software, and other references.)

     When Tux Paint loads an image that's not the same size as its drawing
     canvas, it scales (and sometimes smears the edges of) the image so that
     it fits within the canvas.

     To avoid having the image stretched or smeared, you can resize it to Tux
     Paint's canvas size. This size depends on the size of the Tux Paint
     window, or resolution at which Tux Paint is run, if in fullscreen.
     (Note: The default resolution is 800x600.) See "Calculating Image
     Dimensions", below.

     Save the picture in PNG format. It is highly recommended that you name
     the filename using the current date and time, since that's the
     convention Tux Paint uses:

       YYYYMMDDhhmmss.png

       * YYYY = Year
       * MM = Month (two digits, "01"-"12")
       * DD = Day of month (two digits, "01"-"31")
       * HH = Hour (two digits, in 24-hour format, "00"-"23")
       * mm = Minute (two digits, "00"-"59")
       * ss = Seconds (two digits, "00"-"59")

     Example: "20210731110500.png", for July 31, 2021 at 11:05am.

     Place this PNG file in your Tux Paint "saved" directory/folder. (See
     above.)

  Calculating Image Dimensions

       This part of the documentation needs to be rewritten, since the new
       "buttonsize" option was added. For now, try drawing and saving an
       image within Tux Paint, then determine what size (pixel width and
       height) it came out to, and try to match that when scaling the
       picture(s) you're importing into Tux Paint.
