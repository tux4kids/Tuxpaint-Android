You should set LIGHT_PATH environment variable for

SDL.dll must be placed on current directory.
SDL_Pango.dll must be placed on ..\VisualC2003\Release.
And 'make merge_module'.

If you want to make sample MSI file, you should place
testbench.exe on ..\VisualC2003\testbench\Release. 
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Merge Modules\VC_User_CRT71_RTL_X86_---.msm
should be there.
And 'make testbench'.

If you want to make development library MSI file, 
SDL_Pango.lib must be placed on ..\VisualC2003\Release.
And 'make dev_vc'.
