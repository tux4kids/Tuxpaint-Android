Hi Bill,

As you recall, we had quite a challange to find a proper free font replacement
for Arial that can be used with TuxPaint when displaying Hebrew.

It seems the problem is now solved.

I used the free font editing software pfaedit (pfaedit.sourceforge.net) to
convert a free Type-1 Hebrew font (culmus.sourceforge.net - released under
the GPL) to ttf and it seems to work well.

You can get the converted font from here:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/kinneret/Nachlieli-Light.ttf

Since the original font is GPLed, I assume you can include this font in future
versions of TuxPaint. The author of the Culmus fonts is also in the cc just
in case you have any questions.

One more issue though - it seems that any attempt to type in Hebrew text (for
the text entry tool) results in beeps. Can you please have a look at that?

Thanks a lot,

Dov.
