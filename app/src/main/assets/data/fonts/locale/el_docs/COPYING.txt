I was mainly looking to see if there were any that were more specifically
written with fonts in mind than the GNU GPL, which I'm somewhat familiar
with. But since you're using the GPL for your definition of source code,
and that's the one I have the most familiarity with, I'll just go with that
one. So you have my permission to distribute my Thryomanes fonts under the
terms of the GNU GPL. (I hope you don't mind that it's missing some
extended Cyrillic characters and most of the Greek Extended section; I
never got around to finishing those parts.)
