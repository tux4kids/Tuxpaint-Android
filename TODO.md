#TODO

- always start the app with the second brush (not the thinnest)
- remove the label "Colors" on the bottom left instead stretch the color buttons in width, so they fill the whole row
- remove the label "Tools" on the left
- add two more buttons at the left bottom:
    - 1. button to disable sound
    - 2. button to enable child mode
      # child mode:
        - auto selects the brush with 4px size
        - hides the area below the color buttons (with the text and the penguin), instead grow all color buttons in height so they fill all the space all the way down to the bottom of the screen
        - replaces the right button row with only one big slider up and down for the brush-size
        - replaces the left buttons with only some big buttons:
            - paint
            - eraser
            - fill
            - save
            - new:
                - will autosave the current picture
            - undo
            - redo
            - exit child mode

# later TODO (not for now)
- multitouch support when erasing
